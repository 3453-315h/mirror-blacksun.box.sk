			 Creating a Search Engine in PHP
                            

 This is the first in what I hope will be a long list of tutorials that I like to
call Practical Programming in PHP, PPP for short. So lets get down to business, 
today I'm going to show you how to create a search engine that you can use for 
your very own site or some other project that you may be working on. For this 
tutorial I will be using a MySQL database, the bulk of the code should be 
compatible with PHP 3 and 4.

Backround:
 Before we begin I'll show you the table I'll be using in the examples:

    _______________________________________
   | First_Name | Middle_Name | Last_Name  | 
   -----------------------------------------       
   | Dana       | Johnson     | Smith      |
   -----------------------------------------       
   | Jill       | Angel       | Petersburg | 
   -----------------------------------------
   | Jack       | Coner       | Mitchel    |
   -----------------------------------------

 If you feel confused about any of the functions have a look at my previous 
tutorial that deals with common database functions.

Down to Work:
 Before we actually make the search engine we need to create a basic webpage that
will have an input field where the user can enter his or her search query. I'm 
going to keep mine simple, feel free to make an elaborate one with lots of bells
and whistles. The code for my page is below:

	  <html>
	  <head>
	    <title>Simple Search Engine version 1.0</title>
	  </head>
	  <body>
	  <center>
	    Enter the first, last, or middle name of the person you are looking for:
	    <form action="search.php" method="post">
	      <input type="text" name="search_query" maxlength="25" size="15"><br>
	      <input type="reset" name="reset" value="Reset"> 
	      <input type="text" name="submit" value="Submit">
	    </form>
	  </center> 
	  </body>
	  </html> 

 That's a pretty basic page so I'm not going to explain alot of it. Basically the
user will enter the first, middle, or last name of the person they are looking for
and hit enter. The contents of the input field will be passed to a php script named
search.php and that will handle the rest.

 Now that the page is out of the way let's create the actual script. First we want
to actually connect to the database using mysql_pconnect() and select the table using
mysql_select_db(), then we want to parse the value passed to the script to see if
it contains any invalid input, such as numbers and funky characters like #&*^. You
should always validate input, don't rely on things like JavaScript to do it for 
you because once the user disables JavaScript all that fancy validation goes down
the toilet. Now to check the input we are going to use a regular expression, they
are a bit confusing and will be explained in a later tutorial. For now all you need
to know is that it will check to see if value passed is a string of characters. 
All right enough chatter, here is the first part of the script:

    <?php 
      mysql_pconnect("host", "username", "password") or die("Can't connect!");
      mysql_select_db("Names") or die("Can't select database!"); 
          
	    if (!eregi("[[:alpha:]]", $search_query))
      {
        echo "Error: you have entered an invalid query, you can only use characters!<br>";
				exit;
      }

 Now that we've done that we will form the search query.

    $query= mysql_query("SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE First_Name= '$search_query' OR Middle_Name= '$search_query' OR Last_Name= '$search_query' ORDER BY Last_Name");

  Look confusing? I'll explain, what is pretty much happening is we are asking MySQL
to search all the rows in First_Name, Middle_Name, and Last_Name for a match to 
the query entered by the user, after it has found some results we then ask MySQL
to alphabetize the results by Last_Name.

  The rest of the coding from now on is a breeze. We will get the results from 
the query using mysql_fetch_array( ) and check to see if there is a match using 
mysql_num_rows(). If there is a match, or matches, we will output it along with 
the number of matches found; if there isn't we will report to the user that we 
couldn't find anything.

      $result= mysql_num_rows($query);
      
			if ($result == 0)
      {
        echo "Sorry, I couldn't find any user that matches your query ($search_query)";
        exit; 
      }
      else if ($result == 1)
      {
        echo "I've found <b>1</b> match!<br>";
      }
      else {
        echo "I've found <b>$result</b> matches! <br>";
		  }
      
      while ($row= mysql_fetch_array($query))
      {
        $first_name= $row["First_Name"];
        $middle_name = $row["Middle_Name"];
        $last_name = $row["Last_Name"];
        
        echo "The first name of the user is: $first_name.<br>";
        echo "The middle name of the user is: $middle_name.<br>";
        echo "The last name of the user is: $last_name. <br>";
      }
    ?>

 I added that extra if statement so that when we report how many users we've 
found it's output will be in proper English. If I we don't the script will echo 
"I've found 1 matches" which obviously isn't good grammar :P The rest of the 
script basically loops through the results and prints them to a webpage. That's
all, we've finished the script! The entire script is included below:

    <html>
    <head>
      <title>Simple Search Engine version 1.0 - Results </title>
    </head>
    <body> 
    <?php 
      mysql_pconnect("host", "username", "password") or die("Can't connect!");
      mysql_select_db("Names") or die("Can't select database!"); 
      
			if (!eregi("[[:alpha:]]", $search_query))
      {
        echo "Error: you have entered an invalid query, you can only use characters!<br>";
				exit;		//No need to execute the rest of the script.
      }

      $query= mysql_query("SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE First_Name='$search_query' OR Middle_Name= '$search_query' OR Last_Name='$search_query' ORDER BY Last_Name");

      $result= mysql_numrows($query);
      
			if ($result == 0)
      {
        echo "Sorry, I couldn't find any user that matches your query ($search_query)";
        exit;		//No results found, why bother executing the rest of the script?
      }
      else if ($result == 1)
      {
        echo "I've found <b>1</b> match!<br>";
      }
      else {
        echo "I've found <b>$result</b> matches! <br>";
			}

      while ($row= mysql_fetch_array($query))
      {
        $first_name= $row["First_Name"];
        $middle_name = $row["Middle_Name"];
        $last_name = $row["Last_Name"];
          
        echo "The first name of the user is: $first_name.<br>";
        echo "The middle name of the user is: $middle_name.<br>";
        echo "The last name of the user is: $last_name. <br>";
      }
    ?> 
    </body>
    </html> 

Conclusion:
 Well that just about wraps up part 1 of the Practical Programming series. The 
pages I create were extremely simple because the focus was on the script, you 
should jazz up your pages with images and other cool effects. If you found any 
errors or have any comments please e-mail me (kindly direct questions to the 
message board).

[15:21:16] [Teolicy]   IP has internal division to networks.
[15:21:18] <Schnitzel>   nooooogaaaaa
[15:21:32] <Blandest>   yooooooav
[15:21:33] [Teolicy]   All computers on the same physical broadcast medium, are also on the same subnet.
[15:21:44] <Blandest>   what's up?
[15:21:46] [Teolicy]   Err... well, mostly.
[15:21:48] <Schnitzel>   nothing.
[15:21:49] [Teolicy]   (I will soon explain)
[15:21:49] <Schnitzel>   u?
[15:22:06] [Teolicy]   The subnet mask allows an IP stack to understand which part of the IP address is Network and which is Address.
[15:22:08] [Teolicy]   Examples:
[15:22:20] [Teolicy]   192.168.4.64 tries to ping 192.168.4.128
[15:22:30] *** tomi-m (111@212.3.208.186) has joined channel #israel
[15:22:32] <Blandest>   listening to pearl jam- no code.. orit lended it to me
[15:22:38] <Schnitzel>   nice
[15:22:42] [Teolicy]   How would 192.168.4.64 know if it should send the packet on the wire or to a router?
[15:22:44] <Schnitzel>   i'm just missing snOOpy... :)
[15:22:55] *** tomi-m (111@212.3.208.186) has left channel #israel
[15:23:00] <KK>   But IP already knows which is a network and which is an address according to the "Class" thingy
[15:23:02] [Teolicy]   It checks it's IP after the mask, and checks the destination's IP after the mask.
[15:23:05] <KK>   Class C, B, A, etc
[15:23:08] <Blandest>   yeah she is missing here
[15:23:10] <KK>   no?
[15:23:16] [Teolicy]   KK: No, not really. Class is just a convention, it's not...
[15:23:22] [Teolicy]   Well, I will explain, second.
[15:23:37] <KK>   Oh, Classes are a convention of the IANA,
[15:23:41] [Teolicy]   Now, let's say 192.168.4.64 has subnet 255.255.255.0 mask.
[15:23:43] <KK>   while Subnets are a part of the IP RFC?
[15:23:50] <KK>   then .64 is the address part?
[15:23:55] [Teolicy]   KK: Uhm, don't catch my words for it, but yeah.
[15:24:02] [Teolicy]   Now, we AND with the mask to checkout the network:
[15:24:03] *** Signoff: Web (Web@RAS3-p6.nt.netvision.net.il) has left IRC [Ping timeout for Web[RAS3-p6.nt.netvision.net.il]]
[15:24:22] [Teolicy]   192 AND 255, 168 AND 255, 4 AND 255, 64 AND 0 = 192.168.4.0
[15:24:36] [Teolicy]   192 AND 255 .... 4 AND 255, 128 AND 0 = 192.168.4.0

[15:24:54] [Teolicy]   So you see, both the source (192.168.4.64) and the destination (192.168.4.128) are in the same mask.
[15:25:03] [Teolicy]   Err... in the same subnet.
[15:25:03] <KK>   yea
[15:25:13] <KK>   well, is that all? I understand
[15:25:16] [Teolicy]   That means that there is no need for routing - you can just put the packet on the wire.
[15:26:29] [Teolicy]   If we're sending 192.168.4.64 --> 192.168.5.64, then the nets are different (192.168.4.0 != 192.168.5.0) - so we have to route via a router (usually to the default gateway on single homed hosts).

[15:29:27] [Teolicy]   You can have more than one network on the physical medium by separating their subnets.
[15:30:16] [Teolicy]   The stack will ignore braodcasts not intended for it's network (192.168.4.64x255.255.255.0 will ignore a broadcast to 192.168.5.255, etc).

[15:30:44] [Teolicy]   According to IANA (or something like that), IP networks are divided to classes (which you know about).
[15:30:52] [Teolicy]   You can also sub-divide a class to a subnet.
[15:31:10] <KK>   Subdivide a class to a subnet? Why would I do that?
[15:31:21] <KK>   Oh
[15:31:22] <KK>   Walla
[15:31:24] <KK>   for Class A and B
[15:31:33] [Teolicy]   Because you have only 256 valid IP's, one of which is network and one of which is broadcast (0/255).
[15:31:46] *** Joker^ (nope@RAS1-p91.jlm.netvision.net.il) has joined channel #israel
[15:31:46] [Teolicy]   And you are an ISP and have 4 clients, and want to give 32 IPs to each one.

[15:32:01] [Teolicy]   So, if you have: 212.1.2.0x255.255.255.0, you give the clients:
[15:32:44] [Teolicy]   (clients as in, People Who Bought IPs, not as in, hosts. Sorry for the ambiguoity)
[15:33:04] [Teolicy]   Subnet mask 255.255.255.224
[15:33:14] [Teolicy]   This gives them 32 IPs per netowrk, and we get:
[15:33:47] [Teolicy]   212.1.2.0 - 212.1.2.31 -- Subnet one. Network address: 212.1.2.0, Broadcast: 212.1.2.31
[15:34:05] <KK>   Hmm
[15:34:14] <KK>   So a subnet mask isn't always 255/0
[15:34:17] <KK>   okay
[15:34:21] [Teolicy]   212.1.2.32 - 212.1.2.63 - Subnet two. Network address: 212.1.2.32, broadcast 212.1.2.63

[15:35:27] <KK>   so, what is The True Way?
[15:35:32] [Teolicy]   Stupid NT Cloobies like myself usually use a "subnet calculator" (there are such utils).
[15:35:43] [Teolicy]   But a Linux-Fu master like you would simply love this simple rule:
[15:35:57] [Teolicy]   As you know, IP address' are divided into 4 octets, 1 byte each.
[15:35:58] [Teolicy]   That'
[15:36:00] [Teolicy]   Err.
[15:36:03] [Teolicy]   That's 32 bits.
[15:36:10] <KK>   right, for IPv4.
[15:36:21] [Teolicy]   A subnet of 255.255.255.0, is actually 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

[15:37:56] <KK>   Right, because I AND everything with ones
[15:37:57] [Teolicy]   That's because all the address is network, and no bits are left for host.

[15:55:14] <KK>   few days ago WiZ_Of_oZ had something of the sort
[15:55:22] <F^nor>   unzip; strip kk; mount -t kk; yes; yes; yes; umount kk; zip *j/k*
[15:55:25] <KK>   /me is back from =/ taking a dump /=
[15:55:34] <KK>   and you said
[15:55:37] <KK>   "man that's disgusting!"
[15:55:41] [Teolicy]   (both aren't exact - ...252 is a 2 HOST network (remember that we waste 2 IPs), and 224 is a 30 host network.)
[15:55:41] <KK>   did you have to share that?
[15:55:47] <KK>   or something of the sort
[15:56:09] [Teolicy]   ROFL@F^nor Linux Screw
[15:56:52] <F^nor>   How can I eat less rice than I currently do?
[15:56:58] <F^nor>   I haven't eaten rice in... 7 months or so
[15:57:25] [Teolicy]   It's important to note, that subnets don't always look like this 1111111111(more ones)000000(more zeroes).
[15:57:27] <F^nor>   I did?
[15:57:35] <F^nor>   Am I lagged?
[15:57:46] [Teolicy]   Sometimes you can see 255.255.252.255 - that's a FOUR IP network, no more.
[15:57:46] <F^nor>   hmm
[15:57:47] <F^nor>   i don't remember
[15:57:49] <F^nor>   I can't remember last week at all
[15:58:01] <F^nor>   ok, i'm officially lagged
[15:58:18] [Teolicy]   (we don't raise to a power of 256 when we reduce from high significance octets)
[15:58:27] [Teolicy]   I think that's about it.
[15:58:37] [Teolicy]   Err.. no. That's about all I know, that is. :)

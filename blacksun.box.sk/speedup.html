<br>Are you using Windows (my condolences)? Are you using a modem (not
including cable modems or LANs)? Then you might need to change some hidden
settings on your machine. No need to steal a better modem off the shelf!
Just follow our advises and your modem will be faster, your crush will
kiss you and you will never ever receive any chain letters.
<br>You see, Windows (95 and 98) comes optimized for LANs. It is possible
to change several settings to make your modem almost 2 times faster (actually,
that's 2 times more efficient).
<p>This is where we once had a couple of sections on how to change these
nice settings. However, we decided to devote an entire tutorial to this
cause. Get <a href="modopt.txt">this text file</a> and start reading.
<p><u><font size=+2>More ways to speed up your modem</font></u> <font size=-1>which
do not require you to use Windows nor require any changes in your settings
(mostly)</font>
<p><u>Prefetching</u>
<br>Yes, prefetching! It means that your browser downloads the next pages
you're about to surf to while you're reading!
<br>Okay, let me give you an example. You're in a page with 3 links from
it. While you're reading this page, a special program downloads the next
pages so when you'll finish reading and click on them they will be immedietly
displayed.
<br>I do not know which is the best prefetching program, but you can try
your luck at <a href="http://www.webattack.com">Web Attack</a> (find the
surfing acceleration category).
<p><u>Multi-Sockets Downloads</u>
<br>Big words, little mind? No problem, I'll explain. Basically a program
that supports Multi-Sockets Downloads is downloading the files you tell
it to in a rather... different way. Instead of opening one socket (the
simplest explanation I can come up with is an "outgoing connection") and
using it to download the file, Multi-Socket Downloaders use several sockets
to connect to the file in different fragments ("pieces") of it and downloads
them all at the same time. It even makes downloads from slow servers faster,
since it deploys several connections. More information at <a href="http://www.lidan.com">http://www.lidan.com</a>
(this guy sucks at web design but his program rocks). The program is currently
under development stages and I don't recommend using it since it's not
very comfortable to use and it may even screw up your browser (it screwed
up mine... ;-) ). Guess we'll just have to wait...
<br>Note: there's only a Windows version at this time. Sorry, fellow Unix
users... if you find a similar program for Unix please <a href="mailto:barakirs@netvision.net.il">send
me a nice Email</a>.
<p><u>DNS Caching</u>
<br>No need to explain. Simply get <a href="caching.html">this tutorial</a>
and learn everything you need to know about this great way to speed up
your connection.

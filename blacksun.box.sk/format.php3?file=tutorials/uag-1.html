<p>(actually, I totally revamped this guide, but the first version was kript0n's 
  guide. I just made it unix-gloabl and not just Linux. I will make both of the 
  versions available on my site, when it goes up again (rtfm.org.il). -elad)</p>

  <font size="4"><b>1) Intro to the text</b></font><br>
</p>
<p>unix security is a hard subject. What this means is that you can never be sure 
  that your system completely safe. However, there are some things that can be 
  done in order to make it as safer. This file intends to explain some of these 
  techniques and means of keeping a system running in a safe way. </p>
<p><br>
  <font size="4"><b>2) Security Matters</b></font><br>
</p>
<p>Probably the first thing a system administrator has to deal with is the install 
  process. First of all, comes the question of what unix variant to choose.</p>
<p>Every distribution has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some Linux distributions 
  will &quot;bring back to life&quot; old 486 machines so you can use them as 
  small workstations or small servers, yet most of the Linux distributions will 
  just fill up your disk with un-needed software. My recommendation if you're 
  going with Linux is Slackware.</p>
<p>Also, knowing the &quot;role&quot; of your computer is important when choosing 
  a variant. OpenBSD, for example, will make sure you'll get a stable and secure 
  system, that hardly ever fails or crashes. FreeBSD is good if you're going to 
  put up a site that will handle heavy loads of traffic (i.e., Yahoo.com), or 
  need a fast yet stable workstation. NetBSD is good if you need a small, fast, 
  stable system, or planning to manage a very large network and want the same 
  variant for different computing platforms (i386, SPARC, m68k, VAX, Alpha, handheld 
  PCs..). If you're going to be working a lot with graphics (and I don't mean 
  Photoshop stuff), you might consider getting an SGI workstation and IRIX. If 
  you're going to be handling a lot with databases (especially Oracle), you should 
  get Solaris and a SPARC. </p>
<p>In the installation process, install only the base system. Do not install things 
  because they look &quot;useful&quot; or sound that way. Install something after 
  you've read enough documents in order to understand what it is, does, and how 
  to work and configure it well. Many security breaches are actually misconfigured 
  services, or applications that the admin installed and totally forgot about 
  (because she actually did'nt really needed them, just install them).</p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b>2.1) Post-installation measures</b></font><br>
</p>
<p>After you decided the &quot;role&quot; of your system and installed only the 
  base, and I mean _only_ the base in order to get a secure and safe system, you 
  should install the applications and packages to help your system do its job. 
  If it's going to be a web server, install Apache or some other WWW server and 
  learn how to configure it well.</p>
<p>If it's going to be a mail server, install a mail server you feel comforatble 
  with. This can be procmail, qmail, sendmail (8.9.3 only), or anything else. 
  Don't forget to configure it and learn how to operate it _before_ you're using 
  it. </p>
<p>If your system is going to be a database server, install your database software 
  and configure it well. And so on. But never forget - misconfiguration is your 
  enemy. </p>
<p>Make sure you install only what you need. Never install &quot;extra&quot; software. 
  If you do, make sure you know how to operate it and that it came from a trusted 
  source. Never forget to configure software before using it.</p>
<p>This security measure of &quot;installing what you need&quot; is a part of 
  the &quot;you decide what goes and what not&quot; perception. That starts in 
  installing, continues with configuration and logging, and probably ends with 
  a good firewall. </p>
<p>But even after you install just what you need and configure it well, your system 
  is not yet safe..</p>
<p><br>
  <b>2.1.1) inetd?</b><br>
</p>
<p>In most guides, the author recommends commenting out (by adding the &quot;#&quot; 
  sign as a prefix to a line) services and daemons you don't need. Here, we go 
  a little further and suggest to totally shut down inetd. This daemon (inetd) 
  starts services which are not useful in 99% of the cases, like RPC services 
  - which are very insecure and vulnerable, telnet - which should not be used 
  now that we have OpenSSH (telnet does not encrypt sessions which is a security 
  breach), FTP - that can be started by executing `ftpd -D` (or -USD, if you want 
  to add logging of current sessions and anonymous downloads) from the init part, 
  etc.</p>
<p>By shutting down inetd and editing your inits you gain maximum control of your 
  system's daemons and services, because _you_ are the one that decides what goes 
  on and what not. I find it comfortable to add entries to /etc/rc.conf (if you 
  use BSD style inits) and accordingly adding the entries to /etc/rc - That way 
  you get easy control of the flags and the operation status, etc. If you're using 
  SYSV style inits, just add (or remove) entries from the rc files (as far as 
  I remember it's rc.inet1 and rc.inet2 under Slackware, e-mail me if you have 
  information about other systems, I don't have access to any system with SYSV 
  init style except Slackware).</p>
<p>It's relatively simple to add entries, here are a few very basic examples, 
  both of BSD and SYSV init style. Here, I added Snort (Network Intrustion Detection 
  System) to run on startup:</p>
<p>(BSD INIT STYLE)<br>
  /etc/rc.conf:<br>
  snort=&quot;-A full -c /etc/snort.rules -d -D -s -i -ep0 -e -s&quot; # Use NO 
  to disable</p>
<p>/etc/rc:<br>
  if [&quot;X${snort}&quot; != X&quot;NO&quot; ]; then<br>
  echo 'starting snort' ; /usr/local/bin/snort ${snort}</p>
<p>(In this case, if the variable &quot;snort&quot; in /etc/rc.conf is set to 
  NO, snort will not run. If otherwise, it's assumed that its value are the flags 
  that should be used when starting it.)</p>
<p>(SYSV INIT STYLE)<br>
  /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1:<br>
  echo &quot;starting snort&quot;;<br>
  /usr/local/bin/snort -A full -c /etc/snort.rules -d -D -s -i ep0 -e -s</p>
<p>(Here, we just tell the script to echo &quot;starting snort&quot; and then 
  run it. We can add it to the &quot;starting daemons: ...&quot; line, but that 
  would take more space from this guide, and that's not the topic we're discussing)</p>
<p>So anyway, it's pretty easy adding entries to your inits. Read the manual about 
  the services and daemons you want to use in order to figure out what flags you 
  want.</p>
<p>Of course.. If you do decide to leave inetd running, comment out anything you 
  don't want and restart it, as follows:</p>
<p># killall -1 inetd</p>
<p>If you're system has no killall command, use `ps -x | grep inetd` and write 
  down the PID of inetd, then execute the following command replacing PID with 
  the inetd PID:</p>
<p># kill -1 PID</p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  <b>2.1.2) Running nmap</b><br>
</p>
<p>(nmap can be obtained from www.insecure.org/nmap)</p>
<p>Nmap is a network exploration tool and security scanner. What this means is 
  that it probes a computer or series of computers for open ports, and can also. 
  After you're done with the changes to the inits and the services and daemons 
  management, execute nmap as follows:</p>
<p>nmap -sT -sU -P0 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>Now you must analyse the output from nmap to check your unwanted open ports. 
  The output of nmap can be something like:</p>
<p>...<br>
  Interesting ports on localhost (127.0.0.1):<br>
  (The 1520 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)</p>
<table width="307" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr> 
    <td width="116">Port</td>
    <td width="87">State</td>
    <td width="102">Sevi&ccedil;e</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="116">25/tcp</td>
    <td width="87">open</td>
    <td width="102">smtp</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="116">80/tcp</td>
    <td width="87">open</td>
    <td width="102">http</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="116">113/tcp</td>
    <td width="87">open </td>
    <td width="102">auth</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="116">...</td>
    <td width="87">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="102">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's see. Here you can see some open services, such as smtp, http, and auth. 
  In your machine these can be many more, but if you managed the services and 
  daemons, they won't. Lets analyse one of the lines.</p>
<table width="307" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td width="118">25/tcp</td>
    <td width="94">open</td>
    <td width="93">smtp</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The first field is the port the daemon is running on, which is 25 in this case. 
  You can also see that that same port is open (second field, State). The service 
  column refers to the service that is running on that same port (it is passive, 
  nmap has a list much alike your /etc/services that gives it sort of indication 
  what service runs on what port. Of course, this is not always true, as my machine 
  runs OpenSSH on port 23, and nmap tells it's telnet.). This means that you have 
  a smtp daemon running and accepting connections at the port 25. You can confirm 
  this by telnetting to that port like this:</p>
<p>telnet localhost smtp</p>
<p>You can substitute smtp by the portnumber (25 in this case). You'll see that 
  the connection is accepted. Well, now for the real messy thing about this. If 
  your machine is listening for connections for daemons you don't want and don't 
  pay attention, your machine can get exploited due to the lack of updates on 
  the daemon running at that same port. This is the reason why services not used 
  should be closed, and this is very important (as I mentioned above).</p>
<p>Remember... If you have a service you don't need and will not use, CLOSE IT. 
  Comment the line in the inetd.conf like explained above and remove any lines 
  at the init scripts that direct to the daemon you want eliminated.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>2.1.3 - The passwords</b><br>
</p>
<p>The passwords in a unix system are vital so that access can not be granted 
  to unwanted persons. A bad choice of a password can compromise all your system, 
  and in worse cases, the entire network. So lets see how a good password is formed.</p>
<p>Rules:<br>
  * Never use dictionary words<br>
  * Never use only lower case passwords<br>
  * Try to use a combination of lower case, upper case and symbols<br>
  * Don't use a very small password. At least 6 characters</p>
<p>Then what is a good password and a bad password?<br>
  Good One - iNt3rN4ti0nAl<br>
  Bad one: milk<br>
  Terrible one - root<br>
  Ultra-Terrible - aaa (*)</p>
<p>(*) a password like this is cracked in less than 5 minutes soo if you are using 
  one of these... Get a life... Or change it NOW! Of course, access to the shadow/master 
  password file can be granted only to the superuser, and if someone has this 
  kind of access on your system.. Changing the password is only one drop in ocean 
  of operations you need to perform. CERT has a good document on root compromise 
  recovery. I suggest you read it. (<a href="http://www.CERT.org" target="_blank">www.CERT.org</a>)</p>
<p>A question that may come up is how to check if a password is good or bad. You 
  can use the &quot;vpass&quot; tool which uses the cracklib to verify if the 
  password is easily found or not. </p>
<p><br>
  <b>2.1.3.1 - Using vpass</b><br>
</p>
<p>What this tool can do for you is verify if a password you give is easy to<br>
  crack or not. Lets see some usage examples:</p>
<p>kript0n@phyber:~ &gt; echo &quot;guest guest&quot; | vpass<br>
  ERRNO 3: do not use your user name as password</p>
<p>kript0n@phyber:~ &gt; echo &quot;guest l33t&quot; | vpass<br>
  ERRNO 5: unsuitable password because it is too short.</p>
<p>kript0n@phyber:~ &gt; echo &quot;guest hAx0rZ&quot; | vpass<br>
  OK </p>
<p>I think these examples are easily understood but let's se the usage of vpass.<br>
  This program verifies combinations of user/password unless the option -u is<br>
  given. take the example of the second usage. 'echo &quot;guest l33t&quot; | 
  vpass&quot;. The<br>
  echo gives vpass the user and password combination so that it can verify.<br>
  Therefore, &quot;guest&quot; is the username and &quot;l33t&quot; the password. 
  Not that hard to<br>
  understand, is it?</p>
<p><br>
  <b>2.1.3.1 - Password Changing</b><br>
</p>
<p>To make your computer systems more secure, ask users to change their passwords 
  periodically. For a high level of security, you should require users to change 
  their passwords every six weeks. Once every three months is adequate for lower 
  levels of security. System administration logins (such as root and sys) should 
  be changed monthly, or whenever a person who knows the root password leaves 
  the company or is reassigned. Many breaches of computer security involve guessing 
  a legitimate user s password (often called Social Engineering). You should make 
  sure that users avoid using proper nouns, names, login names, and other passwords 
  that a person might guess just by knowing something about the user. Modern systems 
  will make sure you don't choose a bad password, and has a password worth validation 
  built into the passwd utility.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>2.4 - Logging</b><br>
</p>
<p>Managing a good and reliable logging facility is vital in order to keep your 
  system secure and keep you, the admin, aware of problems, errors, and anything 
  else that occures. </p>
<p>Almost every server software for unix has logging, so make sure you know where 
  each log goes. You can configure it to log to a certain directory that will 
  contain your system's log files (I recommend /var/log). Know the log format 
  of each software you use and have the ability to understand it. Some applications 
  allow you to custom your own log format - Do so.</p>
<p>Most applications and system services use the syslog daemon as their logging 
  facility, or at least have an option to do so. A basic /etc/syslog.conf file 
  (the one that controls the syslog daemon logging) may look somewhat like this:</p>
<table width="57%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td>/etc/syslog.conf:</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td># /etc/syslog.conf </td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>auth.*</td>
    <td>/var/logs/auth.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cron.*</td>
    <td>/var/logs/cron.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>daemon.*</td>
    <td>/var/logs/daemon.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>kern.*</td>
    <td>/var/logs/kernel.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mail.*</td>
    <td>/var/logs/mail.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mark.*</td>
    <td>/var/logs/mark.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>syslog.*</td>
    <td>/var/logs/syslog.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>user.*</td>
    <td>/var/logs/user.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>*.=debug</td>
    <td>/var/logs/debug.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>*.=info;*.notice;*.warn</td>
    <td>/var/logs/messages.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>*.warn;*.crit;*.emerg</td>
    <td>/var/logs/warnings.log</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td># end of /etc/syslog.conf</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> Analysis of the file: You can see that it records messages in different files 
  according to the topic of the messages (i.e., the auth messages whose topic 
  is password and authentication, are logged to the file /var/logs/auth.log). 
  This is in my opinion a good policy because when something fails, you know exactly 
  which file to look. Of course, it is very basic. Some services has their own 
  facilities, and some has other names to the logs. Just read the manual of your 
  software.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>2.5 - Secure ttys</b><br>
</p>
<p>As you probably know, you can connect and login remotely to unix systems. Also, 
  there's a user called the superuser (often it is root), that has access to any 
  system resource or file. A long time ago, if you had the root password you could 
  remotely login and takeover the system. Today, there's something that stands 
  between you and the login session, or at least makes sure that you won't be 
  able<br>
  to login as the superuser on certain devices. This is good if you want to allow 
  root access only to the local machine, so in that case you only list the ttys 
  you want to allow superuser login on. The file that control that is either /etc/ttys 
  or /etc/securetty. Edit it accordingly. It usually has a small explanation as 
  its header. Below are examples to both of these files:</p>
<p>/etc/securetty:<br>
  # /etc/securetty<br>
  # Restricts root access to local users:<br>
  tty1<br>
  tty2<br>
  tty3<br>
  tty4<br>
  tty5<br>
  tty6<br>
  # end of /etc/securetty</p>
<p>/etc/ttys:<br>
  # /etc/ttys<br>
  # this a secure tty:<br>
  ttyC0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;/usr/libexec/getty Pc&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; vt220&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  on secure<br>
  # this is an &quot;insecure&quot; tty:<br>
  ttyp0 none network</p>
<p>In my computers, as you can see, only local users can have superuser access. 
  Therefore, no more root from the outside world. This means that even if someone 
  do have the superuser (root, from now on..) password to your system, unless 
  he has a local account he can't do anything with it. Of course, we will make 
  the system even more secure, so even if someone _do_ have the root password 
  and a local account he can't do anything with it :^)</p>
<p>If you have no idea about what ttys are secure and what ttys are'nt, leave 
  it as your system's default, and or read your system's manual or hope for the 
  best..</p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b>3 - su</b></font><br>
</p>
<p>The su program allows local users to &quot;act&quot; as a given user, or when 
  no user is added as an argument, as the suepruser. Usually, there is no reason 
  for one user to act as another one, so I don't see a reason why even letting 
  users except root permission to use it. If you do want to use it, read its manual 
  before you do so. </p>
<p><br>
  <font size="4"><b>4 - End notes and final measures</b></font><br>
</p>
<p>After doing these things, your system will be much safer. However, it takes 
  some conscience to administer a good system. Don't just install everything you 
  find on your system, because you will be opening holes, like I said before. 
  Keep changing your password (do this on a regular basis) and check your system 
  integrity often. The most important step is to keep a up-to-date system. Just 
  as an example, I update my system every 3 days. Paranoia? Maybe. Secure? Yes.</p>
<p>Subscribe to security mailing lists and to your software vendor's update lists. 
  Be aware of any new holes or patches regarding your system or software and apply 
  them. You can never be too secure.</p>
<p>Also, explore your system. Make sure you know what each configuration file 
  does, and don't be afraid of &quot;fucking stuff up&quot;. That's the best way 
  to learn.</p>

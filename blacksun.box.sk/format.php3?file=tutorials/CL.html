    <p>The Tortuous Path of Early Programming.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In the perpetual darkness more than two miles below the surface of the North 
  Atlantic, a submersible sled slowly traced the alpine contours of the ocean 
  bottom in the summer of 1985. Named the Argo after the ship in which the legendary 
  Greek Hero Jason sought the Golden Fleece, the 16-foot-long craft resembled 
  a section of scaffolding flung on its side and stuffed with equipment, Powerful 
  lights, sonar, Video cameras. Far above, arrayed in front of a video screen 
  in the control room of the U.S. Navy research vessel Knorr, Members of a joint 
  French-American scientific expedition intently watched the images transmitted 
  by the submersible as it was towed above a desolate landscape of canyons and 
  mud slides.<br>
  After 16 days of patient search, A scattering of metallic debris appeared on 
  the screen, followed by the unmistakable outline of a ship's boiler. A jubilant 
  cry arose from the scientists. The ocean liner Titanic sunk 73 years earlier 
  with more than 1,500 of its 2,200 passengers on board had finally been found.<br>
  The quest for the remains of the Titanic in the crushing depths of the sea was 
  a remarkable application of computer technology, as exotic in its means as in 
  its venue. Not least of the keys to the successful outcome was the agility of 
  modern computer programming.<br>
  Argos's ensemble of sonar, lights and cameras was orchestrated by an array of 
  computers that each programmed in a different computer language. The computer 
  on the unmanned Argo itself was programmed in FORTH, a concise but versatile 
  language originally designed to regulate movement of telescopes and also used 
  to control devices and processes ranging from heart monitors to special-effects 
  video cameras. The computer on the Knorr was programmed in C, a powerful but 
  rather cryptic language capable of precisely specifying computer operations. 
  The telemetry System at either end of the finger thick Co-ax cable connecting 
  the vessels, which in effect enabled their computers to &quot;talk&quot; to 
  each other, was programmed in a third, rudimentary tongue known as assembly 
  language.<br>
  Programming languages are the carefully and Ingeniously conceived sequences 
  of words, letters, numerals and abbreviated mnemonics used by people to communicate 
  with their computers. Without them, computers and their allied equipment would 
  be useless hardware. Its own grammar and syntax regulate each language. A programming 
  language that approximates human language and can generate more than one instruction 
  with a single statement is deemed to be &quot;high-level.&quot; But computer 
  languages tend to be much more sober and precise than human languages. They 
  do not indulge in multiple meanings, inflections or twists of iron. Like computers 
  themselves, computer languages have no sense of humour.<br>
  Today there are several hundred such languages, considerably more than a thousand 
  if their variations, called Dialects, are counted. They enable their users to 
  achieve a multitude of purposes, from solving complex mathematical problems 
  and manipulating (or &quot;crunching&quot;) business statistics to creating 
  musical scores and computer graphics. No existing Language is perfect for every 
  situation. One or more of three factors usually determines the choice among 
  them: The language is convenient to the programmer; it is useable on the available 
  computer; it is well suited to the problem at hand. The multiple tongues employed 
  on the Titanic expedition are a case in point. For the computers aboard the 
  surface ship Knorr, C was the preferred language because it provided more direct 
  control of the computerised hardware. FORTH was the only high-level language 
  that could be used on the submersible Argo's computer. And the precise timing 
  required timing required of the signals passed by cable between the two vessels 
  was best accomplished by rigid assembly language.<br>
  As varied languages have become the all build on a common base. At their most 
  fundamental level, Computers respond to only a single language, The high and 
  low of electric voltages representing the ones and zeros of binary code. Depending 
  on how these signals are fed into a computer's memory. Another might be a piece 
  of data yet to be processed.<br>
  Yet another collection of binary digits, or bits, might command the machine 
  to perform a certain action, such as adding to numbers. The circuitry of each 
  type of computer is designed to respond to a specific and finite set of these 
  binary encoded machines, which may be combined and recombined to enable the 
  machine to perform a vast range of tasks. Though straightforward enough this 
  so-called machine is a forbidding, alien language to human beings. A computer 
  program of any size, in its machine-code form, consists of thousands or even 
  millions of ones and zeros, strung together like beads on a seemingly interminable 
  string. A mistake in even one of these digits can make the difference between 
  a program's success and failure.<br>
  Less than half a century ago, machine code was the only means of communicating 
  with computers. Since then, generations of language designers have harnessed 
  the power of the computer to make it serve as its own translator. Now, when 
  a programmer uses the command PRINT &quot;Hello&quot; or the statement LET A 
  = B * (C - D) in a program, a translating program is called into action, converting 
  those commands into the ones and zeros that the machine can understand. <br>
</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="2"></a>2-Paper Tape and Plug-Boards</font></b></p>
<p>The methods used to program the world's first general-purpose computers were 
  as cumbersome and primitive as the machines they served. The historic Mark 1, 
  assembled at Harvard University during World War 2, was a five-ton conglomeration 
  of relays, shafts, gears and dials, 51 feet long. It received its instructions 
  for solving problems from the spools of punched paper tape that were prepared 
  and fed into a computer by small corps if technicians. A more advanced machine, 
  ENIAC (for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), was completed in 1945 
  at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering. 
  Unlike the Mark 1, which was electromechanical, ENIAC was fully electronic. 
  But it was still devilishly difficult to program. Its primary developers, Physicist 
  John W. Mauchly and engineer J. Presper Eckert, had responded to the urgencies 
  of wartime by concentrating on ENIAC's hardware. Programming took a back seat. 
  ENIAC was not even equipped to receive instructions on paper tape. To prepare 
  it for operation, ma team of technicians had to set thousands of switches by 
  hand and insert hundreds of cables into plug boards until the front of the computer 
  resembled a bowl of spaghetti. Not surprisingly, ENIAC's users tried to squeeze 
  the last drop of information out of any given configuration before they undertook 
  to change it.<br>
  These early experiences made it all too plain that a better means of communicating 
  with the machine with the machine was needed if computers were to approach their 
  potential. And even as ENIAC hummed through its first electronic calculations, 
  some forward-looking work on a higher level programming was being done elsewhere. 
  In at least one case, however, many years would pass before the results came 
  to light. <br>
  The Plan Calculus<br>
  Konrad Zuse's world was crashing down around him early in 1945 as the allied 
  military noose tightened on Berlin, his home city. The young German engineer 
  had been working since before the war on a series of relatively small, general-purpose 
  computers, using the living room of his parents apartment as his laboratory. 
  Zuse's efforts were a notable example of parallel yet independent developments 
  in science; he had no idea of the similar progress being made in other nations, 
  and his own government had shown little interest in his computer work. Shortly 
  before the fall of Berlin, Zuse loaded his only surviving computer, dubbed the 
  Z4, onto a wagon and fled with a convoy of other refugees to a small town in 
  the Bavarian Alps.<br>
  During the grim years immediately after the war, Zuse found himself without 
  either funds or facilities to work on computer hardware. Turning his energies 
  to theory instead, he sought a better way to program a computer, not specifically 
  the Z4, but any similar machine. What was needed, he decided, was a system of 
  symbolic and numeric notations based on a logical sequence, in affect a calculus 
  of problem-solving steps.<br>
  Working alone, Zuse devised a programming system that he named Plan Calculus, 
  or, in Germen, Plankak&uuml;l. He wrote a manuscript explaining his creation 
  and applying it to a variety of problems, including sorting numbers and doing 
  arithmetic by means of binary notation (other computers of the day operated 
  in decimal). He also taught himself to play chess and then produced 49 pages 
  of program fragments in Plankak&uuml;l that would allow a computer to assess 
  a player's position. &quot;It was interesting for me to test the efficiency 
  and general scope of the Plankak&uuml;l,&quot; Zuse later wrote, &quot;by applying 
  it to chess problems.&quot;<br>
  Zuse never expected to see his language actually run on a computer. &quot;The 
  Plankak&uuml;l&quot; he wrote, &quot;arose purely as a piece of desk work, without 
  regard to whether or not machines suitable for Plankak&uuml;l programs would 
  be available in the foreseeable future.&quot; Although he briefly visited the 
  United States in the late 1940s, only small portions of his manuscript were 
  published, much less implemented, in the decade after the war; many of his ideas 
  for a systematic, logical language remained unknown to an entire generation 
  of computer linguists. Not until 1972 did Zuses's experts to wonder what effect 
  Plankak&uuml;l would have had if it had been disseminated earlier. &quot;it 
  shows us how different things might have been,&quot; one critic of subsequent 
  languages has noted, &quot;how what we have today is not necessarily the best 
  of all possible worlds.&quot;<br>
  While Zuse was labouring in isolation, a collegial effort to develop a programming 
  language for real machine was under way at academic centres in Great Britain 
  and the United States, where the earliest computers were beginning to be used. 
  But progress was slow. Not only did each computer have its own machine code 
  and programming method, but also developing the machines themselves required 
  the lion's share of the scientists' time and talent.<br>
  During the years immediately after the war, most programmers continued to work 
  on machine code, the binary digits that correspond to a computer' circuits. 
  To make the job slightly easier, some of them began using shorthand number systems 
  to denote combinations of bits, a method akin to a stenographer's using symbols 
  to represent words when taking dictation. The first of these systems was Base 
  eight, also known as octal. Just as there are only two digits, 0 and 1, in the 
  binary system, there are eight in octal, the numerals 0 through to 7. Each of 
  these octal numbers is used to represent one of eight possible combinations 
  of three bits (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 and 111). A more ambitious 
  numbering system that followed is base 16, or Hexadecimal (hex, to us programmers), 
  Gathered into groups of four. The 16 possible combinations of four bits were 
  represented by the numerals 0 through to 9 and the letters A through to F. Eg. 
  Black #000000 White #ffffff.<br>
  A Penchant for Gadgets<br>
  To at least one frustrated American programmer, the modest progress offered 
  by such number systems seemed grossly insufficient. Grace Murray Hopper was 
  accustomed to being in the vanguard. She had grown up fascinated by things mechanical, 
  &quot;gadgets&quot;, she called them. As a girl of seven she had taken apart 
  all the wind-up alarm clocks in her family's summer home in New Hampshire, to 
  discover how they worked, However she could not put them back together. The 
  'spanking' that followed failed to dim her scientific enthusiasm. After graduating 
  with honours from Vassar College in 1928, she earned a Ph.D in mathematics at 
  Yale, a rare achievement for a female, and then returned to Vassar to teach.<br>
  At the height of World War 2, Hopper joined the U.S. Naval Reserve, and in June 
  1944 she earned her commission. Her contribution through the years would be 
  prodigious. Lieutenant Hopper was assigned to the navy team that was developing 
  programs for the Mark 1 at Harvard. &quot;Mark 1 was the biggest, prettiest 
  gadget I'd ever seen,&quot; She later Said.<br>
  The programming team Hopper joined consisted of two male ensigns, she subsequently 
  learned that when the men heard that a &quot;grey-haired old college professor&quot; 
  was coming, one of them bribed the other so that he would not have to take the 
  desk next to hers. Hopper soon proved her worth as a programmer, however. &quot;I 
  had an edge,&quot; she said. &quot;I had studied engineering as well as mathematics, 
  and I knew how the machine worked from the beginning. Of course, I was lucky. 
  When I graduated in 1928, I didn't know there was going to be a computer in 
  1944.&quot;<br>
  In 1949, a civilian again, Hopper joined the fledgling Eckert-Mauchly Computer 
  Corporation, Which was operating out of a old factory in North Philidelphia. 
  Mauchly and Eckert had left the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School in 
  1946 after a bitter fight over patent right to their electronic computers. Once 
  ain business for themselves, they secured several contracts and set about building 
  a new machine that they hoped would prove the commercial viability of computing. 
  They called the machine the Universal Automatic Computer, or UNIVAC.<br>
  The Hidden Perils of Octal<br>
  Grace Hopper had learned how to work in octal, teaching herself to add, Subtract, 
  multiply and even divide in the strange system. &quot;The entire establishment 
  was firmly convinced that the only way to write and efficient program was in 
  octal,&quot; she later lamented (the prevailing view was that the computers 
  time was more valuable than the programmer's; if a program could be executed 
  swiftly, the difficulty of writing it was immaterial). And indeed octal proved 
  very helpful in getting the company's prototype computer up and running. She 
  was having trouble balancing her personal bank account, an embarrassing dilemma 
  for a trained mathematician. Finally, she appealed to her brother, who was a 
  banker, and after several evenings' work he solved the mystery. Occasionally 
  she was subtracting a check in octal rather than the decimal system in the bank, 
  and everyone else used. &quot;I face a problem of living in two different worlds,&quot; 
  Hopper said. &quot;That may have been one of the things that motivated me to 
  get rid of octal as much as possible.&quot;<br>
  Hopper's efforts to ease the programmer's burden (and keep her chequebook balanced) 
  would eventually shape the course of computing. But she was not alone in the 
  attempt. Shortly before she came to Philadelphia, John Mauchly made a suggestion 
  that would take programming a first tentative step beyond octal and Hexadecimal's. 
  He directed his programmers to devise a computer language that would allow a 
  person to enter problems into the machine in algebraic terms, an approach that 
  Konrad Zuse would have approved of. By the end of 1949, the system, known as 
  Short Code, was operational. Later promoted as an &quot;electronic dictionary,&quot; 
  it was a primitive high-level language and a definite improvement over machine 
  code. A programmer first wrote the program to be solved in the form of mathematical 
  equations and then used a printed table to translate their equation symbols 
  into two-character codes. For instance, a parenthesis became 09, while the plus 
  symbol became 07. A separate program in the computer then converted these codes 
  to ones and zeros, and the machine performed the appropriate functions.<br>
  Short Code's partner program was essentially a primitive &quot;interpreter&quot;, 
  a language translator that converts the high-level statements in which a program 
  is written into simpler instructions for immediate execution. As programming 
  languages evolved, interpreters would become one of the two basic categories 
  of language translators.<br>
  New advances in languages soon overtook Short Code, but its central idea endured. 
  Far from being simply glorified adding machines, computers are consummate manipulators 
  of symbols, whether those symbols represent numbers, letters, colours, or even 
  musical notes. A computer has no difficulty taking the code numerals 07 and 
  performing the sequence of steps that leads it to add two numbers, as long as 
  it has been programmed to recognise 07 as the symbol for addition. In the same 
  manner, it can take a complete statement, such as IF N &lt; 100 THEN PRINT N/47, 
  and translate it into the basic machine instructions that will enable the hardware 
  to carry out the desired task. This purposeful manipulation of symbols is the 
  fundamental principle behind all programming languages.<br>
  Although short code was never a commercial success, the language made a deep 
  impression on Grace Hopper. &quot;Short code was the first step toward something 
  which gave a programmer the power to write a program in a language that bore 
  no resemblance whatsoever to the original machine code,&quot; she said. But 
  before the promise of Short code could be realised, much more had to be done.<br>
  The British Contribution<br>
  The pace of progress in computer languages was tightly bound to advances in 
  computer hardware, and during the late 1940s there were few such advances. Most 
  of them were influenced by Mauchly and Eckert's early work and could in fact 
  trace their origins to a specific event: a series of lectures held at the Moore 
  School in the summer of 1946.There, Mauchly and Eckert discussed the successor 
  to ENIAC they were planning. Dubbed the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic 
  Computer, or EDVAC, it would dramatically reduce the labour involved in changing 
  from one program to another by storing its programs and date electronically 
  in an expanded internal memory.<br>
  One participant in that summer was Maurice V. Wilkes, then head of the Mathematical 
  Laboratory at Cambridge University. Inspired by the lectures, Wilkes returned 
  to England and set about designing a machine based on the EDVAC concept, construction 
  began in 1947. Named the electronic storage Automatic Calculator, or EDSAC, 
  it became operational in 1949, well before Mauchly and Eckert's firm produced 
  its first commercial computer.<br>
  Like many early computers, EDSAC was a finicky performer. One programmer recalled 
  that even the sound of a airplane flying overhead could bring it to a halt. 
  Whatever EDSAC was shut down for any reason, a set of &quot;initial orders&quot; 
  had to be loaded into the machine to enable it to accept programs again. This 
  process made a whiring sound, which was a signal for everyone who wanted to 
  use the computer to come running, Programs in hand. Those fortunate enough to 
  have offices nearest the computerusually ended up in the front of the queue. 
  The others might have to wait a long time. <br>
  At first, EDSAC could perform 18 basic operations (modern computers usually 
  have a capability of 200), each of them triggered by a particualar sequence 
  of ones and zeros. Early on, EDSAC's designers decided not to force its programmers 
  to use this machine code in their programs. instead they set up a system of 
  mnemonics in which each machine instruction was represented by a single capital 
  letter. Thus S meant &quot;Subtract&quot;, I meant &quot;Read the next row of 
  holes&quot; T meant &quot;Transfer information to storage&quot; and Z meant 
  &quot;Stop the machine&quot;. When a programmer typed a mnemonic on a specially 
  adapted keyboard, the corresponding binary instruction was punched into a papertape, 
  which could then be fes to the machine.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="3"></a>3-Buiding a Library.</font></b></p>
<p>Even more valuable than the mnemonics devised for EDSAC was the library of 
  subroutines set up for the machine. Subroutines were already a familiar concept 
  in computing: Grace Hopper and her group had used the on the Harvard Mark 1. 
  But they continued to pose their own peculiar problems. Subroutines are independant 
  sections of the computer program that are used over and over and are called 
  for by the main program when needed.Early programmers often kept notebooks containing 
  the comman used subroutines so that they did not have to start from scratch 
  when one was needed. The problem was that the addresses that designated where 
  each of a subroutine's instructions and varibles were to reside in memory changed 
  according to where the subroutine occured in the program.<br>
  Maurice Wilked called the EDSAC scheme of mnemonics and subroutines an assembly 
  system, Commanly known as Assembly.<br>
  Assembly code reamsins in use today because of its close relation to the machine, 
  an assembly language is machine-specific, designed to correspond to the set 
  of machine-code instructions wired into a particular computer's CPU. Thus, assembly 
  lanuage is a favourite of programmers who want to compress their programs into 
  the smallest possible space in memory and have them run as fast and efficiently 
  as possible. These attributes made it ideal for programming the telemetry system 
  used by the Titanics finders.<br>
  Anyone writing in assembly language has to be intimately familiar with how a 
  computer does things, To know, for example, the many steps required simply to 
  add 2 numbers. Assembly written for one computer would be totally gibberish 
  to another computer.The language was a creation of a brilliant english mathematician 
  Alan M. Turing. <br>
  By 1948, Turing was in charge of programming he prototype of a real computer 
  called Mark 1, the machine that was being constructed at the University of Manchester. 
  (It was not related to the Mark 1 of Harvard). The manchester Mark 1used combinations 
  of five binary digits to represent the machines different instructions, with 
  each instruction requiring four such combinations, or 20 bits. Intending to 
  make the Mark 1 easier to program , Turing installed a system in which a mnemonic 
  symbol was substituted for each of the 32 combinations of Zeros and Ones possible 
  with a five-bit code. The symbols Turing assigned to the combinations were the 
  letters, numerals and punctuation mark of a standard teleprinter keyboard. For 
  Example, a slash (/), or &quot;stroke&quot; to the British, stood for 00000, 
  or zero, an R stood for 01010, and so up to a &pound;, representing 11111.</p>

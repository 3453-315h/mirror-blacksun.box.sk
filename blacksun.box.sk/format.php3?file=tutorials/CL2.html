<br><a NAME="giant"></a>Three Commercial Giants
<br>**********************
<p>Late one Friday afternoon in April of 1957, The postman delivered a
mysterious package to the computer centre at the Westinghouse-Bettis Atomic
Power Laboratory near Pittsburgh. Programmer Herb Bright and a couple of
his colleagues, with most of the week's work behind them, were loitering
in a hall way just outside the room housing their sleek new IBM 704. Out
of curiosity, they opened the unlabelled box. It contained 2000 punched
computer cards, but no instructions or explanation of any kind.
<br>&nbsp;Bright had a hunch about the cards, something interesting, he
knew, was going on at IBM? For months now, the big Computer Company had
been cleaning the bugs out of a high-level language intended for use on
the 704. Called FORTRAN, for Mathematical Formula Translating System, it
was an automatic coding system designed to take out some of the effort
out of programming. Was it possible the postman had delivered the long
awaited Fortran compiler, The software necessary for translating FORTRAN
into Machine code?&nbsp; With anticipation the Programmer Bright and his
friends decided to load the mystery cards into the 704 and see what happened.
<br>&nbsp;As the machine digested the information on the cards, its memory
tapes turned and stopped. When the tapes were still, the computer's ready
light glowed. Bright fed a test program, written in FORTRAN, into the 704's
reader and pressed the start button. The printer chattered. The new compiler
had a message for its users; it had found an error in the program, a comma
missing from a statement on card No. 25. The programmers were amazed at
this precision. The error messages they were accustomed to seeing were
cryptic numerical codes and were hard to track down. They corrected the
mistake and hit the start button again. The tapes started running, and
the computer produced a small deck of program cards. When these were fed
into the reader, the printer started up and did not stop until it had filled
28 pages with output. The 74 had made a few minor Format errors. "But the
numbers right!" Bright Claimed "Computing would never be the same".
<br>&nbsp;Bright and his Co-workers had just joined the ranks of the earliest
users of FORTRAN, the first widely available high-level language. Its introduction
was probably the most important milestone in the history of computer languages.
Since that day in 1957, the number of programmers using, and occasionally
abusing, FORTRAN has grown large enough to populate two fair-sized cities.
<br>&nbsp;A generation later, FORTRAN had come to be considered something
of a relic among computer languages. Programmers have called it a "dinosaur"
or a "Intellectual roadblock" and even "a collection of warts held together
by bits of syntax." In the caustic opinion of software authority Edsger
Dijkstra, teaching FORTRAN to computer science students should be punishable
as a capital offence. Nevertheless, decades after its origin, FORTRAN remains
one of the most popular of all languages. Its capacity for manipulating
numbers has earned it a vast following of scientist and Engineers. Its
ability to swallow and digest long strings of numbers, however, is only
a partial explanation for its remarkable staying power. Much of its longevity
must be credited to the simple fact that FORTRAN was there first.
<br>&nbsp;The researchers at IBM who created FORTRAN had no idea their
language would have the enormous impact it did. When they began work early
1954, Computer science was a freewheeling, rough-and-ready affair. Years
later, the team's chief, John Backus, recalled, "Recognition in the small
programming fraternity was more likely to be accorded for a colourful personality,
an extraordinary feat of coding, or the ability to hold a lot liquor well
than it was for an intellectual insight. Ideas flowed freely along with
the liquor.
<br>&nbsp;Programmers and computer scientists were a new breed. Their resumes
were short. One IBM manager of the time decided that chess players made
good programmers, so he interviewed prospects while watch them play a member
of his staff, who happened to be the US chess champion. Few of the eight
men assigned to the FORTRAN project had more than a passing familiarity
with computers. They were drawn from Universities and from aircraft companies,
as well as from IBM's own programming ranks. Even John Backus had only
a few years experience with computers when he launched the FORTRAN project.
<br>&nbsp;Prior to his college days, Backus had been an awful student;
He had been thrown out of more schools than he could remember. After serving
a hitch in the arm during World War 2, he drifted to New York and enrolled
in a school for radio technicians on the GI Bill. His Instructor at school
who taught radio/TV repair made Backus' interest in the potential joys
of mathematics and encouraged him to continue his studies at Colombia University.
In this modest fashion began one of the most creative careers in computer
history.
<br>&nbsp;Backus was 25 years old, and as soon as he finished his master's
degree, he went to work for IBM as a programmer in 1950. Before long, he
was leading the team that developed the interpreter called Speed-coding,
used on the IBM 701. Then he turned his hand to hardware design, as part
of the team that was building a more powerful successor to the 701, the
IBM 704. Late in 1953, Backus, who said that he had "always been a lazy
person", approached his boss with a labor saving suggestion, a sophisticated
language and compiler to make the new 704 a less difficult task. His system
would allow the user to write programs in algebraic notation. The compiler
would translate this notation into machine code automatically.
<br>&nbsp;Backus' suggestion came at a good time. After a late start, IBM
was pushing hard to increase its computer sales. To this end, the company
supported programs in computer science at Colombia, Harvard and several
other universities. But IBM was still looking for a way to bring down the
high cost of programming and make computers less intimidating, in effect
"friendlier" to their users. Most scientists, engineers and educators had
neither the time nor the patience to use machine code or Assembly language,
which required a reasonably intimate knowledge of how the computer itself
actually worked. But they might be persuaded to learn a high-level language,
especially if it resembled familiar algebraic formulas. Backus was given
the green light.
<br>&nbsp;FORTRAN's Birthplace was the IBM world-headquarters building
on Madison Avenue in New York. Backus' group settled into offices on the
19th floor, within a few metres away from the buildings Lift Machinery
and surrounded by what might be described as an atmosphere of scepticism.
Earlier attempts to improve on machine code and ASM (assembly language)
had in some cases been oversold as "almost human" means of communicating
with computers, a claim that tended to foster disbelief. But the FORTRAN
team pushed on. They structured their new language with basic notions such
as assignment statements N = 100, for example, that specified values for
variables, which told the computer which item in a list of variables was
desired, for example, X(3) meant the third item in the list Called X. And
they included the very important DO statement, which allowed looping, or
repeating a series of instructions a number of times. According to Backus,
most people "think FORTRAN's main contribution was to enable the programmer
to write programs in algebraic formulas instead of machine language, but
it wasn't" Instead, Backus has said, "what FORTRAN did primarily was to
mechanise the organisation of loops", a device that became invaluable in
scientific applications.
<br>&nbsp;Work on the language itself went quickly. "We simply made up
the language as we went along," Backus recalled. But developing a compiler
was another matter. Backus realised that to allay the computer community's
serious doubts about the worth of automatic programming, as writing programs
in high-level languages was called, FORTRAN programs would have to be as
fast and dependable as those written directly in machine code or ASM.
<br>&nbsp;Structuring an efficient and reliable FORTRAN compiler turned
out to be far more challenging than had been imagined. The team had to
concern itself with input, output, DO loops and the host of intricate steps
necessary to transform high-level commands into machine code. Early plans
called for the compiler to be completed within six months, in fact, six
months remained the unchanged interval to completion for more than two
years. Through the end of 1956 and into 1957, the pace of refining and
debugging the compiler grew intense. Team members often rented rooms in
a midtown hotel, where they slept by day and then worked all night at the
office to get in as much uninterrupted computer time as possible. One by
one, the bugs were exterminated until, in April 1957, the compiler seemed
ready for customers who had already leased the 704. Owing to what Backus
described as a "vast confusion," the FORTRAN compiler was sent to Westinghouse-Bettis
in punched card for, without instructions. This set the stage for Herb
Bright's successful attempt to fly FORTRAN blind. Other users received
the system on magnetic tape, along with the operator's manual.
<br>&nbsp;Acceptance was not high at first. As Backus recalled, programmers
"were extremely sceptical about all of our claims." But compared to its
predecessors, FORTRAN was relatively easy to learn and use. And IBM was
providing the system without additional charge for use on the 704. As a
result, by 1958 more than half the machine instructions at some 60 IBM
computer installations nationwide were being produced automatically by
FORTRAN and not by hand.
<br>&nbsp;Backus and his team anticipated that the success of FORTRAN would
prompt other manufacturers to develop similar languages for their own machines,
and eventually they did. But FORTRAN gradually became the norm, adapted
to a wide variety of computers. The first adaptation took place at IBM
itself. A small team that included David Hemmes, a newcomer to IBM with
a passion for racing hotrods in his spare time, set out to make FORTRAN
compatible with the IBM 650, a smaller machine than the 704. Hemmes and
colleges developed a system they dubbed FOR TRANSIT, later made in to one
word. FORTRANSIT thus became the first major translator of source code
on more than one kind of computer. And within five years, FORTRAN was in
use on half a dozen different IBM models, as well as on machines made by
Sperry Rand, Philco and other manufactorers.
<br>&nbsp;Not all of FORTRAN's sailing was so smooth. Early in 1957, while
the debugging process was still going on, shortcomings in the language
were already becoming clear. Backus and his designers saw the need for
an even clearer diagnosis of program errors and a similar need for the
use of subroutines, program sections that can be seperally prepared and
used repeatedly. This gave rise, only about a year after the original,
to FORTRAN II. Among other improvements, FORTRAN II allowed for links to
assembly-language programs, so that programmers could if they wished, write
their programs partly in assembly and partly in FORTRAN. Later versions,
FORTRAN III was written in 1958 and FORTRAN IV was announced in 1962, further
Expanding FORTRAN"S capabilities.
<br>&nbsp;The heart of the language, its central statements and expressions,
remained largely untouched over the years. But as FORTRAN was repeatedly
adapted to run on systems for which it had not been designed, changes crept
in. Tinkerers dropped some features and added others. This led inevitably
to confusion over what was and what was legal in FORTRAN. For example,
not all compilers handled the important DO loop in the same way.&nbsp;
Some always executed the loop once before checking whether it should be
executed at all. Others checked before executing. To tidy up FORTRAN, computer
manufacturers and users agreed to a standardisation of the language in
1966 and again in 1977.
<br>&nbsp;FORTRAN is still a popular tool for programming, particularly
among scientists. Most subsequent languages are either its direct or indirect
descendants. But much of its historical significance lies in the fact that
it was the first widely distributed commercial language. AS an IBM manual
in 1957 claimed, FORTRAN "provided a efficient means of writing 704 programs
requiring no knowledge of the computer and a relatively short period of
training." Henceforth, scientists, engineers and students could communicate
with computers without depending on professional assembly-language programmers
doing the work for them.
<p>**************************
<br><a NAME="business"></a>Business comes to computers
<br>**************************
<p>Large corporations, which live by the formula, that time equals money,
recognised the profitable potential in computers that could process huge
quantities of data at high speed. A few programming languages had in fact
been created with business applications in mind. Prominent among them were
FLOW-MATIC, which Grace Hopper had developed for Perry Rand, an IBM business
language called Commercial Translator, and the Air force's AIMACO. But
none of these early languages showed any promise of general acceptance,
and none could function in more than one family of computers, a drawback
true of many other languages appearing at this time.
<br>&nbsp;Just as the Backus team at IBM had predicted, the appearance
of FORTRAN set off a flurry of imitators. But most of these systems were
not portable, they were specific to the computer for which they were designed.
Since large organisations often dealt with more than one supplier, an increasing
portability problem emerged. To keep up with the different languages, Business
programmers were forced to be polyglots. At one point, the Southern Railway
Company had three kinds of computer, three separate computer centres, three
programming staffs, and one large efficiency problem. It was no way to
run a railroad.
<br>&nbsp;In April 1959, two years after the official launch of FORTRAN,
an assortment of concerned users, manufacturers and academics held what
amounted to a council of war at the University of Pennsylvania, on eof
the cradles of computer science. This small band quickly agreed that what
it, and the world, needed was a standardised, machine-independent business
language.
<br>&nbsp;FORTRAN clearly was not the answer. Businesses were interested
in handling payrolls faster and creating accessible lists of potential
customers, not in solving equations. They needed a language that not only
would permit such essential operations as sorting items in a data file,
merging data files and generating useable reports, but would be as much
like spoken English as possible.
<br>&nbsp;Having little faith that any one-computer company could be objective
in such an undertaking, the group begun seeking a neutral sponsor for the
project. A small delegation headed by Grace Hopper approached the Department
of Defence. Hopper had reason to believe the Pentagon would be interested
in a highly portable business language. By 1959, DOD already had a regiment
of computers, no fewer than 1,046 of them, of every available size and
type. It was costing the government nearly $500 Million a year to keep
the disparate machines running and to program them in an ever-increasing
number of languages. DOD shared the concern of many computer companies
that a single manufacturer might soon corner the market. If that happened,
DOD and other major users would be forced to deal with only one supplier.
Most manufacturers were more than willing to help the Pentagon see to it
that the market remained open.

<br><a NAME="codasyl"></a>The Birth of CODASYL
<br>***********************
<p>Responding with unusual alacrity to the Hopper delegation's overture,
the Defence Department organised a special conference on computer languages,
which met during the last week of May 1959 and was chaired by Charles Phillips,
DOD's blunt-spoken director of Data Systems Research. The meetings would
later be called CODASYL, for Conference on Data Systems Languages. Important
suppliers such as Honeywell, general electric, boroughs, national cash
register, philco, Sperry rand, radio corp. of America, Sylvania electric
Products and IBM sent representatives. Phillips told them that the pentagon
anted a uniform programming language and wanted it soon.
<br>&nbsp;The conferees responded to the challenge, as computer people
often do, by dividing the problem in to steps and tackling it by numbers.
They formed committees: A short-range task group would draw up a basic
design; an intermediate group would use those specs to fashion a workable
programming system, and a long-range group would, over a period of years,
develop what CODASYL members hoped would be the last word in computer languages.
A CODASYL Executive Committee, also chaired by Phillips, would oversee
the whole process. As events turned out, however the long-range committee
never existed except as an empty box on an organisation chart, the intermediate-range
committee accomplished little, and the short-range committee ended up doing
most of the work of creating the new language.
<br>&nbsp;"It was by no means clear then that we were to do anything except
try and combine the three known business languages of the time," said Jean
Sammet, a Sylvania representative and a key member of the short-range committee.
Sammet's group was able to come up with a temporary solution, something
that would give the intermediate-range group time to construct a more sophisticated
product. So the short-range committee made an attempt to fit together major
pieces of FLOW-MATIC, AIMACO, and Commercial Translator. The pieces would
not mesh. But after a summery of hard Labor, several committee members
felt they could build on these earlier languages and create one with an
identity all its own.
<br>&nbsp;At this point, the political difficulties of the committee structure
became evident. The representatives of IBM took a forceful stand: Any attempt
to write a wholly new language would carry the short-range task group dangerously
beyond its mandate. Most of the committee, including its chairman, Joseph
Wegstien of the National Bureau of Standards, disagreed. Wegstien rather
grandly compared the committee's work to that of the constitutional convention
of 1787. If those delegates had not gone beyond their original charter,
he argued, "We would not have a constitution." Despite the uncertainty
about the short-range committee's role and apparent attempts to scuffle
its efforts, the committee pushed ahead. By mid autumn the new language
had a definite shape and even a name. It was named Common Business orientated
Language (COBOL for short). But the political struggle over its creation
had only begun.
<br>&nbsp;Events had caught members of the intermediate-range committee
off guard. They had assumes that they, not the short-range committee, would
design the new language. In October, they met and suprized everyone by
passing a resolution that endorsed an entirely different language: FACT
(Fully Automatic Compiling Technique), an innovative data-processing language
that for months had been quietly under development at Honeywell. The specifications
for FACT included serval attractive features, such as data entry via cards
and an easy to use report writer. The resolution called CODASYL executive
committee to replace COBOL specifications with those of FACT. Naturally,
this outrages members of the short-range group, especially Jean Sammet,
the Honeywell representative on her committee had been "remarkably silent"
about the existence of FACT. "As can be imagined," Sammet wrote later,
the resolution "had the effect of a major bombing on the short-range committee."
<br>&nbsp;The behind the scene tug of war that ensued continued until the
next meeting of the Executive committee. Feelings on both sides of the
issue ran high. Unwilling to concede such a marketing advantage to Honeywell,
most of the other companies lined up against FACT, and their wishes prevailed.
When the Executive committee convened in January 1960, it simply did not
vote on the FACT resolution. The issue was raised at a later meeting, but
by that time the committee had already approved the COBOL specifications.
<br>&nbsp;Thus COBOL survived another attempt to bury it. Had a grave marker
been needed, CODASYL chairman Charles Phillips already had one on hand.
Sometime prior to the January meeting a heavy crate had been delivered
to Phillips' office, inside he found a small marble tablet with a recumbent
lamb on top. Chiselled into the stone was the word "COBOL." There was no
epitaph.
<br>&nbsp;Numerous Epitaphs have been written since for COBOL, all of them
for premature. Now more than a quarter of a century old, the language is
far from dead. By the end of the 80's, COBOL programs worth well over $50
billion were running on business networks. An investment that virtually
guarantees the language's outliving. Companies are reluctant to undertake
additional costs by switching to a new system, even though the new one
might prove more efficient in the long run, (Hence one of the factors of
Microsoft's Dominating Hold over Operating Systems used in the business
force, And why I am writing this tut in windows Notepad!). Moreover, COBOL
has been updated regularly and is still very good at the job it was originally
made for, processing business data.
<br>&nbsp;The American business committee took to COBOL almost from the
start. Specifications for Cobol were published in April 1960, and by the
end of that year, RCA and Sperry rand were marketing their own COBOL Compilers.
Other manufacturers hurried to do the same. Conspicuously absent from the
early rush to COBOL were IBM, which continued to promote commercial translator,
and Honeywell, which had been stung by the FACT controversy. Eventually,
even these holdouts made COBOL available to their customers, and the language
quickly eclipsed both FACT and Commercial translator.
<br>&nbsp;The popularity of COBOL increased after the release of a new
version in 1962. More powerful than its predecessor, the revised COBOL
included a report writer and made use of the SORT verb. Interestingly,
these features had been strong points of FACT. The watchdog CODASYL committee,
which was not disbanded and has continued to meet regularly, has approved
many subsequent versions of COBOL. As the number of data-processing departments
using COBOL grew through the 1960's, a computer journal compared the language
to crab grass: Despite attempts to root it out it kept springing up and
spreading.
<br>&nbsp;COBOL serves business well for several reasons. The language
is particularly effective at applying simple processes (Addition, subtraction
and the figuring out of Percentages, for example) to very large data files.
It is also machine independent, programs written in COBOL may be moved
from one computer to another (unlike most previous Computer Languages).
And because COBOL employs ordinary English words and syntax, executives
and managers unfamiliar with programming often can understand the code.
(In a typical program, the computer may be instructed as follows: IF SALARY
IS GREATER THAN 1000, PERFORM CHECK-SALARY-ROUTINE.) This makes readability
so much easier, and also makes error checking far easier, Well-maintained
COBOL programs have been known to outlast the computers that they run on.
<br>&nbsp;Created to handle filing operations on masses of data, COBOL
is not, as it turns out, a very good general-purpose language. Many mathematical
and scientific programmers, the aristocrats of computer society, consider
it verbose and cumbersome, like FORTRAN, it is often labelled as a Dinosaur.
Yet Cobol's employment on a vast scale continues, maybe not so much as
the early 90's but it still lives!
<br>&nbsp;Even before the introduction of COBOL, a third attempt to create
a universal computer language was under way. ALGOL, for Algorithmic Language,
was an algebraic language like FORTAN, designed primarily for writing programs
to solve numerical problems. Like COBOL, It was born in Smoke-hazed committee
rooms, the child of confrontation and compromise. But here the similarities
stop. After years of wrangling, the ALGOL committees gave the world a language
that attracted more interest than it is do users. ALGOL was perhaps the
first language that could accurately be called elegant, a term Grace Hopper
(who? See Computer languages 1) has defined as "like a poem, simple and
clear from a mathematical point of view, but not necessarily practical."
<p>***********************
<br><a NAME="zurich"></a>A Gathering in Zurich
<br>***********************
<br>The impetus for ALGOL came from the introduction a rapid spread of
FORTRAN in 1957. The computer community in Europe feared domination by
IBM and other aggressive American Figures, meanwhile in America, programmers
were try anxious to establish a universal language for scientific programming.&nbsp;
This widespread anxiety spawned an international summit. Talks began at
the Swiss Federal Technical University, in Zurich, on May 27, 1958. When
this first meeting adjourned little more than a week later, the entity
that would be known as ALGOL 58 had come into being. Around the table at
Zurich were gathered eight of the most respected names in computing, four
each from Europe and the United States. John Backus, the Father of FORTRAN,
was there, as was Joe Wegstien, who later would chair the COBOL short-range
committee.
<br>&nbsp;The conference took as it motto the words of Voltaire: "The Best
is the enemy of the good" - Meaning does not delay forever trying to make
it perfect. Even so, progress was hard to achieve. The Americans argued
for a language that would lend its self to workable compiler systems. The
Europeans were less interested in compilers than in the power of the language
to solve complex mathematical problems. On the second day, the talks almost
broke down over a small but emotional issue, decimal points. One of the
Europeans pounded on the table and shouted "No! I will never use a period
for a decimal point." The Americans, on the other hand, had nothing but
pure hate for the European notion of using a comma as a decimal point.
That night, the tireless Wegstien trudged from room to room trying to calm
the decimal point tempest.
<br>&nbsp;Wegstein's eventual solution to the problem provided the new
language with one of its more remarkable features. ALGOL would be divided
into three levels, a reference language to define each of ALGOL's concepts,
publication languages to permit programs to be written and discussed, and
hardware languages to allow the programs to be implemented on working computers.
Because the Zurich negotiators would be discussing only the reference language
and not the details of the publication and hardware languages, they could
avoid making decisions about little things such as commas and periods.
<br>&nbsp;The language created by the Zurich conference owed much to FORTRAN.
In ALGOL, basic FORTRAN concepts were shuffled into a more logical, some
would say more graceful, structure. But time restrictions and the need
for compromise left many omissions. One of those was the absence of any
procedure for the input and output of data. The ALGOL conferees had purposely
not tackled this very machine-specific activity, assuming that those who
had chosen to implement the language would write their own input/output
programs. When the conference ended, some delegates went home believing
the language was still far from finished. But the other conferees departed
with high hopes that ALGOL was on route to becoming the longed for international
standard.
<br>&nbsp;One of the optimists was John Backus. In February 1959, he presented
ALGOL to SHARE, the powerful organisation of IBM computer users, and generated
an unexpected wave of enthusiasm. SHARE urged IBM to implement ALGOL. IBM
responded by initiating a translator project, but the work proceeded lazily.
With FORTRANS gathering momentum, the worlds leading marketeer of computers
could hardly be expected to throw its considerable weight behind a computing
language. As months went by and the investment of SHARE's members in FORTRAN
mounted, the users group began to back away from its early flirtation with
ALGOL.
<br>&nbsp;That did not stop Backus. Despite his employer's evident lack
of interest, he continued to play a role in the development of ALGOL. After
returning from Zurich, he became fascinated with syntax, the orderly arrangement
of words and symbols that hols any language together; in computing, syntax
determines if a program is grammatically correct. Backus created a rigorous
and precise system for defining each term in a computer language in a logical
way. For example, to define the term "digit" he wrote "&lt;digit>: = 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|."
Soon programmers were referring to this approach as Backus Normal Form
(BNF), A subsequent refinement of the work by the Danish Astronomer Peter
Naur led some to call it Backus Naur Form, but the Acronym BNF remained
the same. BNF was to have a lasting influence on language design. It also
laid the groundwork for a second round of discussions on ALGOL.
<br>&nbsp;As problems with implementation grew and the promise of Zurich
faded, the authors of ALGOL came to view their 1958 language as merely
a draft.&nbsp; Clearly more work was needed. In January 1960, thirteen
representatives from Europe and the United States, including seven from
the original Zurich group, met in Paris to fill in holes left in ALGOL
the first time round. One of the newcomers was Naur, who brought a proposed
draft of a revised ALGOL written in BNF. Joe Wegstien, who served as chairman,
wielded a firm gavel, but it has been said that the Paris Conference produced
only one unanimous decision: A vote to pose a group photograph. Still,
after eight days of tricky negotiations, the conference left Paris in an
optimistic mood, believing that a consensus had been reached and that even
the most vocal critics of ALGOL would now be silenced. This proved not
to be the case. Members of the American contingent had barely stepped off
their plane, when the new ALGOL 60 came fire from within. A minority faction
from the conference pointed to a doubtful thought of the remaining in the
language and proceeded, uncharitably, to demonstrate them. Other critics
complained that the language still had no input/output facilities.
<p>***********************
<br><a NAME="diverg"></a>Transatlantic Divergence
<br>***********************
<p>With SHARE now committed to FORTRAN, ALGOL 60 received a cool reception
in America. Those who wanted to use it found it difficult to implement,
even the most sophisticated computers of the time could not translate the
full 116 characters in its reference language character set. A few of the
more romantically inclined members of the American community, however,
looked at ALGOL and saw "an object of stunning beauty" the poetic elegance
that Grace Hopper described. They were not alone.
<br>&nbsp;The Europeans loved ALGOL. It allowed them to communicate powerful
and complex ideas across borders and language barriers, and it freed European
computer industry from what had threatened to become utter reliance on
American technology. Just as the US Department of Defence lent crucial
support to COBOL, the influential German Research council and other European
Government agencies did the same for ALGOL. Energetic efforts to put ALGOL
to work spread the language from Great Britain to the former Soviet Union.
Some of these attempts failed, for instance, an ambitious system in Britain
was scrapped when programmers discovered their ALGOL compiler could process
only two characters a second. But most compilers proved highly successful,
and ALGOL soon became the "lingua franca" of the European computer community.
<br>&nbsp;Not so in the United States. Granted, ALGOL eventually found
its way onto many American computers, but it never overcame the head start
FORTRAN had gained in the market place. The less than vigorous support
of American interests killed any possibility of ALGOL's evolving into the
universal language that some had envisioned. Still, the theoretical impact
of ALGOL was a significant in the United States as it was in Europe. The
ALGOL 60 report became a testament for a generation of programmers and
students of computer languages.
<br>Over the years, a number of languages have been based at least in part
of ALGOL, and its contributions to these languages include several major
ideas. One of the most important is the concept of block structure, the
dividing of programs into a number of self-contained units. Another is
recursion, the ability of a program to refer to its self. A third, credited
to Backus' BNF, is the Formal definition of syntax, the precise way that
words in the language are to be used. These and other fundamental concepts
constitute the ALGOL legacy to computer-language designers.
<br>&nbsp;IBM would take a careful look at that legacy when the computer
colossus embarked on an ambitious language project late in 1963, in conjunction
with the development of new line computers. Two years earlier, the company
had realised that it needed to make a giant leap forward in technology
if it wanted maintain its market primacy. The result of that decision was
the System/360, an impressive array of general-purpose computers. The result
of that decision was the System /360, an impressive array of general-purpose
computers. The machines were designed to handle with equal finesse the
analytical computing needs of the scientific community and the data-processing
needs of business, while filling the varied requirements of special-purpose
users as well.
<br>&nbsp;Naturally, these full-spectrum computers called for a powerful
language to match. Inexplicably handy in realising this, IBM had waited
until six months before the scheduled unveiling of its new hardware to
launch the language development effort. SHARE, realising its stake in the
matter, helped IBM put together and Advanced Language Development Committee.
This team composed of SHARE representatives from Lockheed, Union Carbide
and Standard Oil of California and included experts from IBM's own programming
and language design departments would take on the challenge of creating
the new language. IBM compiler specialist George Radin was named to head
the Project.
<br>&nbsp;The programmers were pressed for time right from the very start
of the project and with the release of the System /360 scheduled for April
1964, they pushed hard to get it finished on time. With lovers of FORTRAN
all over the country hoping the new language would be taken off the blue
prints of the FORTRAN, The committee finally rejected FORTRAN, however
the debate about this delayed the project about seven weeks. FORTRAN was
too
restrictive as a general-purpose language so it seemed. Despite managements
urging's, specifications for the new language were not achieved until February
1964, By then it was too late for the Committee to succeed in making a
Language before the Scheduled release of the System /360. Infact, the language
after constant refining, did not get released until December 1964. The
Produced language named PL/1 for Programming Language 1 was promptly likened
to a Swiss army blade, containing everything but the kitchen sink.
<br>&nbsp;Hoping that implementation would clear up most of PL/1's problems,
IBM's laboratory in Hursley, England, set upon creating a compiler for
PL/1. Hursley found it needed a 200-page report to define the massive language.
Hursley then had to edit it so much so that on the finished product, the
original creators of PL/1 didn't recognise it as their own work. But the
refinements in the language had made it into a practical tool that many
programmers welcomed it in December.
<br>&nbsp;IBM had hoped that PL/1 would be the grouping of all that had
been learned about languages from the past few years. PL/1 showed it influences
from FORTRAN, COBOL and ALGOL, but at the same time it had its critics.
They believed that PL/1 was created to "perpetuate" the mistakes of the
past.

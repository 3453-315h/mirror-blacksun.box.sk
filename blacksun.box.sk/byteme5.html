Figure 1.1 Wiring Specifications</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Supplies Needed:<br>
=================<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4: NICs (Network Interface Cards) (20$ each)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4: 4 pair RJ45 Wiring (Long enough to reach to the hub) (25 cents/foot)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1: Hub (50-100$)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1: DSL/Cable Modem/IC (???$)</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Hardware Setup 1:<br>
=================<br>
Open up the computer.  Open the NIC and look for the following ISA/PCI slot
that looks like it will fit into, then slip the card down, and push firmly. Make sure the card is 
fully pushed in (May require sum extra umph).  Screw in the NIC to the case at the top of the paddle 
on the NIC.  Screw the screw back in the case, and wha la!</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Software Setup 1:<br>
=================<br>
Boot up the machine, when windows attepmpts to boot you should get a PNP  
dialog box (Plug n' Play).  It will ask you to select the correct driver, if it's
already there just select it, if not stick in the data disc (driver disc), and  select the 
appropriate driver from there.</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Haredware Setip 2:<br>
==================<br>
Plug all the wires in the NICs and the HUB.<br></font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Server Software Setup 1.1:<br>
=================<br>
*The following instructions will most likely only work on a windows 98 machine.<br>
<br>	
=== This paragraph talks about ICS, skip if you don't want to use it. ===<br><br>
First, before the network is setup, we will install internet connection sharing (ICS).  
Go to Start--&gt;Settings--&gt;Control Pannels--&gt;Add/Remove Software
--&gt;Windows Setup (Tab) --&gt; Select Internet Explorer from the list and
double click --&gt; Check the top box that says: &quot;Internet Connection
Sharing&quot;, click ok, then click ok again.  About this time another dialog box should 
open up to try and configure ICS, just keep clicking the next button, and you're done when
you click the finish button (If you're feeling zesty you can make a driver disk).
Then it's going to want you to restart, so go ahead and do that.  Once you've 
booted back up again go to the control pannels, and open up your network
settings. Oh, by the way, you're going to need that win98 disk (or 
C:\Windows\Options\Cabs).</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Network settings, hurahh!  Ok, make sure the first thing that is in there is Client for Microsoft 
Networks.  If not click Add--&gt;Client, Add--&gt;Microsoft, then bingo, there it is.  Ok, make 
sure TCP/IP (What ever you NIC is) is in there as well, if not, don't fret. Ok, now if something 
is already installed in this section, ignore it. Click add, go to protocol, click add again select
Microsoft again, and add the following if not pressent for your NIC: NetBEUI, TCP/IP, and IPX/SPX.
For file and print sharing click the big button that says: "File and Print Sharing" and select what 
ever is approrpriate.</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Configuring addresses for the server: Double click TCP/IP (NIC) and go to the IP Address tab.  Select the 
specify an IP address radio button.  For the IP address either use: 192.168.0.1  or 10.10.10.1
the reason is those are private public addresses that wont conflict with exiting networks.  For the
subnet use 255.255.255.0  Select WINS Configuration and make sure disable WINS Resolution is bubbled in.  
Don't worry about the rest of the tabs.  Click ok, then selct TCP/IP Internet connection sharing and open up it's
properties and make sure Obtain an IP address automatically is selected in the IP address tab and in the wins 
congiguration tab that USE DHCP for WINS Resolution IS SELECTED!  Ok, click on the Idenification tab in the 
network properties and give your a pc a name, and name the workgroup, try to keep the workgroup name the
same on the server and the individual pcs unless once again you're feeling zesty, (It'll make more sense when 
the network is up and running as to why).  Then you're all done configuring the server.  All done.</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Configuring Individual Machines<br>
(Non Server) Software 1.2:<br>
=======================<br>
<br>
Once again, make sure the first thing that is in there is Client for Microsoft Networks.  If not add it (Refer to 
above).  Ok, make sure TCP/IP (NIC) is in there as well.</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Ok, now if something is already installed in this section, ignore it. Click add, go to protocol, click add again 
select microsoft again, and add the following if not pressent for your NIC: NetBEUI, TCP/IP, and IPX/SPX.  While 
NetBEUI and IPX/SPX are not needed, NetBEUI will help control your network traffic and IPX/SPX will allow for 
older games that don't support TCP/IP still run over the network.</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
For file and print sharing click the big button that says: &quot;File and Print Sharing&quot; and select what ever is 
appropriate. And it all sounds too familiar, but wait, here comes the hard part! Open up the properies for TCP/IP (NIC), 
and select obtain an IP address automatically, and in wins configuration select Use DHCP for Wins Resolution.
Then go to the indentification and name the computer and the workgroups. Now you need to setup IE to detect the network 
so you can surf the internet.  Open up your internet option in control pannels: Under IE 5.x+:  Select never dial a connection
Click on Lan settings, and automaticall detect settings Under IE 3.x+: Should detect proxy settings automatically.</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
Restart Restart Restart<br>
=======================<br>
Restart Restart Restart Restart Restart Restart Restart Restart Restart Restart Restart Restart all your machines, they 
need a fresh restart. Once the server has reached the logon screen, log the server on, then log the rest of 
the machines on, then presto, it works!</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
File &amp; Print Sharing:<br>
=====================<br>
To share a printer, right click that printer and go to sharing, the give the
printer a name.  To access the printer from any other machines, select add new printer
from the printers folder (Start-->Settings-->Printers), select network printer, and
select the computer that the printer is connected to, then the printer should drop down
beneath the computers icon, select that printer and proceed.</font>

<p><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ffffff" size="-1">
To share folder or hard drives, right click the folder and go to sharing as
well, share it as a name, and you can password protect this folder if you want to (same with
the printer), with read only and full access.  Once you've selected a folder to
share, a hand icon should appear on it, now on any other machine, going to Network
neighborhood and selecting your pc, should see this folder.  If wanted, you can right click
on that folder and have it turn that folder into a network hard drive, either only being
a drive then, or reconnecting at log on.  Works great for sharing mp3s.  Also, this can
be done with cd-roms, zip drives, and cd-rws.  Note: You may not want to run file and
print sharing on your server machine for security reasons (Totally optional).</font>

<br><font size=-1>==================================</font><font size=-1></font>

<p><font size=-1>--by POOL</font>

<br><font size=-1></font>&nbsp;<font size=-1></font>

<p><font size=-1>Hey, this time I'll explain you some stuff about different

devices used to set up a LAN/WAN. It won't be a very indepth explanation.

But just to give newbies a basic understanding, which is very important.

Well, let me start with a router. A router is a device used to route packets

between different segments. Hmm, don't you know what a segment is? Ok, let

me explain this with a diagram:<pre>

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA            BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB

A                            A  ++++++++  B                             B

A  +++++          +++++      A  +router+  B       +++++          +++++  B

A  +PC1+==========+PC2+=========+  or  +==========+PC3+==========+PC4+  B

A  +++++          +++++      A  +bridge+  B       +++++          +++++  B

A                            A  ++++++++  B                             B

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA            BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB

</pre></font>

Well, as you can see, a router devides a network into

segments. PC1 and PC2 are in Segment A, while PC3 and PC4 are in Segment

B. So if PC1 sends a packet to PC3, the packet has te bo routed by the

router between Segment A and B. A router operates on the Transport-layer

and Network-layer in the OSI-model (check my previous article about the

OSI-model (<a href="http://neworder.box.sk">http://neworder.box.sk</a> and <a href="http://blacksun.box.sk/tutorials.html">http://blacksun.box.sk</a>). Allright, now let me

tell you something about bridges. A bridge does the same as a router, it

bridges packets between 2 or more segments. But a router is on the third

and fourth layer of the OSI-model, while a bridge is on the second. So,

a router routes the packets based on IP (Internet Protocol), while a bridge

is only able to perform MAC-based bridging (MAC = Media Access Control).</font><font size=-1></font>

<p><font size=-1>Switches and Hubs, what's their function? Well, if you

want to set up a LAN (which is connected to the Internet) you have to connect

your pc's to the gateway (which connects your LAN to the internet). But

there's (usually) only 1 NIC (Network Interface Card) or modem free to

plug in the cable which leads to your ISP.. :-) So, you have 5 pc's to

connect, that's a problem.. Well, that's when a switch or a hub comes in.

Let me make this clear with another diagram:



<pre>

                +++++   +++++

                +PC2+   +PC1+

                +++++   +++++

                  \___    \

                      \___ \

                          \-++++++++++

              +++++         +  Hub   +            +++++++++

              +PC3+---------+   or   +===Uplink===+Gateway+===>Internet

              +++++         + Switch +            +++++++++

                       ___/-++++++++++

                   ___/    /

                  /       /

                +++++   +++++

                +PC4+   +PC5+

                +++++   +++++

	        

</pre>

I think it's clear by now. But you may be asking yourself

'What's the difference between a Hub and a Switch?'</font>

<br><font size=-1>Ok, you have a 10 mbit hub (5 ports) and 10 mbit Switch

(5 ports). You connect 5 pc's on the hub, and 5 pc's on the switch. You'll

notice that the pc's connected to the switch have a higher connection-speed

than the pc's on the hub. Well, on a 10 mbit switch EACH port provides

10 mbit, but on a 10 mbit hub ALL the ports together provide 10 mbit (so,

10 mbit : 5 ports = 2 mbit each).</font><font size=-1></font>

<p><font size=-1>Ok.. That's all for now.. I hope you learned something.

My DNS-tutorial will be ready before the end of this summer, so check blacksun

and neworder frequently.</font><font size=-1></font>

Using Whois</FONT></B><br><br>

By <a href="mailto:SethJ1223ts@aol.com">Prophecy</a>

<p>Introduction

<br>Whois is a tool that is used to gain information. It comes with most

flavors

<br>of Linux. There are also whois databases. These databases hold information

<br>about the queried domain. Anyone can go and get information on a certain

<br>domain. When the domain is queried it will display the System Admin,

<br>Technical Contact, the DNS servers, and sometimes more or less. Here

I will

<br>teach you how to use whois. You will need to gain a shell account,

if you

<br>don't already have one or unless you have a Linux box.

<p>Syntax of Whois

<br>The basic syntax is whois is: whois domain.com. So if you were to whois

<br><a href="http://blacksun.box.sk">http://blacksun.box.sk</a> it would

look like this: whois<a href="http://blacksun.box.sk"> blacksun.box.sk</a>.

This

<br>will only search using the shell's whois, so it's not all that useful.

The

<br>more useful whois looks like this: whois domain.com@whoisdatabase.

So if you

<br>were going to whois blacksun.box.sk using the Network Solutions (more

on this

<br>later) database, it would look like this: whois

<br>blacksun.box.sk@whois.networksolutions.com. Well that's the basic use

of

<br>whois, for better uses go onto the next section.

<p>More Useful Whois

<br>Now you want to use whois to it's full potential right? This is the

right

<br>section. There are other uses of whois that may give even more information

on

<br>the domain. Here's a scenario: say you don't know if the site is .com,

.edu,

<br>.org, or .net. Go to your Linux prompt and type: whois "domain."@whoisdb.

So

<br>if we were going with the sample acme.net (but we really didnt know

if it was

<br>.net or not) it would look like this: whois "acme."@whois.crsnic.net.

Here is

<br>what the output might look like:

<p>[bash]$ whois "acme."@whois.crsnic.net

<br>[whois.crsnic.net]

<p>Domain names in the .com, .net, and .org domains can now be registered

with

<br>many different competing registrars. Go to <a href="http://www.internic.net">http://www.internic.net</a>

for

<br>detailed information.

<p>ACME.COM

<br>ACME.ORG

<br>ACME.NET

<br>ACME-INC.COM

<br>ACMEINC.COM

<br>ACMETECH.COM

<br>&nbsp;

<p>There you go. Now you can get the one you wanted. Now you do another

whois

<br>with the same database (crsnic.net).

<p>[bash]$ whois "acme.net"@whois.crsnic.net

<br>[whois.crsnic.net]

<p>Domain names in the .com, .net, and .org domains can now be registered

with

<br>many different competing registrars. Go to <a href="http://www.internic.net">http://www.internic.net</a>

for

<br>detailed information.

<p>Domain Name: ACME.NET

<br>Registrar: NETWORK SOULTIONS, INC.

<br>Whois Server: whois.networksolutions.com

<br>Referral URL: <a href="www.networksolutions.com">www.networksolutions.com</a>

<br>Name Server: DNS.ACME.NET

<br>Name Server: DNS2.ACME.NET

<br>&nbsp;

<p>The name servers could be a little different. This method will just

basically

<br>give you minor information. Okay, since the registrar is Network Solutions

we

<br>will have to query their database also. The next query will be in this

<br>format: whois domain.com@whois.networksolutions.com, just like the

above in

<br>the section "The Syntax of Whois". Here is what the command will look

like if

<br>we use the same example: whois acme.net@whois.networksolutions.com.

Now let's

<br>type it in the shell.

<p>[bash]$ whois acme.net@whois.networksolutions.com

<br>[whois.networksolutions.com]

<p>Registrant:

<p>Acme Networks (ACME2-DOM)

<br>11 Town Center Ave.

<br>Einstein, AZ 21098

<p>Domain Name: ACME.NET

<p>Record last updated on 28-April-01

<br>Record created on 30-May-95

<br>Database last updated on 14-Apr-01 13:20:47 EDT.

<p>Domain servers in listed order:

<br>DNS.ACME.NET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.10.10.1

<br>DNS2.ACME.NET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.10.10.2

<p>See, now you can try and social engineer the guy. Keep the handle (WB9201)

<br>and the IP of the first DNS server. Now say you want to find othr domains

<br>associated with acme.net, the whois command would look like this: whois

"HOST

<br>DNS"@whois.networksolutions.com. The DNS part would be the first Name

Server

<br>from above. So if we were to query acme.net it would look like so:

whois

<br>"HOST 10.10.10.1"@whois.networksolutions.com. When you get the results

locate

<br>the HST record. Then type this at the shell prompt: whois "SERVER

<br>HST"@whois.networsolutions.com. HST would be the HST record you just

found.

<br>It should show the other domains associated with it. There is also

another

<br>way to use whois to find associated domains. This on also will be able

to

<br>tell you if the domain is actually ownd by the associated company or

if it is

<br>owned by another company, such as a ISP. Earlier when we did the first

<br>networksolutions.com query we it said that th company's name was "Acme

<br>Networks". So we will use that now. Here is th syntax of the next query:

<br>whois "company_name."@whois.arin.net. So acme.net's qury would look

like so:

<br>whois "Acme Net."@whois.arin.net. The rason we don't put "Acme Networks",

is

<br>because we need to use the "." wild card to see what other companys

there are

<br>named Acme Networks. Here are the results:

<p>[bash]$ whois "Acme Net."@whois.arin.net

<br>[whois.arin.net]

<br>Acme Networks (ASN-XXXX)&nbsp;&nbsp; XXXX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

99999

<br>Acme Networks (NETBLK)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

10.10.10.0 - 10.20.129.255

<br>&nbsp;

<p>If you want even more specific information, you can take the net block

<br>(NETBLK) and do a query on that particular net block.

<p>[bash]$ whois 10.10.10.0@whois.arin.net

<br>[whois.arin.net]

<br>Major ISP USA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (NETBLK-MI-05BLK)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

MI-05BLK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.10.10.0 -

<br>10.30.255.255

<br>ACME NETWORKS, INC.&nbsp; (NETBLK-MI-10-10-10)&nbsp; CW-10-10-10&nbsp;

10.10.10.0 -

<br>10.20.129.255

<br>&nbsp;

<p>Now back to where we got the handle (WB9201). We will now do a query

on this.

<p>[bash]$ whois "HANDLE WB9201"@whois.networksolutions.com

<br>[whois.networksolutions.com]

<br>Boyd, Woody [Network Engineer] (WB2901)&nbsp; woody@acme.net

<br>BIG ENTERPRISES

<br>11 TOWN CENTER AVE

<br>EINSTEIN, AZ 20198

<br>201-55-1212 (201)555-1212 (FAX) 201-555-1212

<br>&nbsp;

<p>Now you can do a whois query as @Acme.net and it will tell the e-mails

<br>assoicated with Acme.net

<p>[bash]$ whois "@Acme.net"@whois.internic.net

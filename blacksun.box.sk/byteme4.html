understand what a daemon is. So anyway, daemons run as TSRs. TSR stands for 
"Terminate and Stay Resident". A TSR, once executed, will stay on your system's 
memory and wait for a certain action to take place (in our case: a connection on 
a certain port), and then do something about it.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT

that. This is where INetD comes to place.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>INetD stands for Internet 
(I-Net) Daemon (D). It is often called "the mother of all daemons". Why? Because 
it is a single TSR that is in charge of invoking other daemons.</FONT></FONT>

command. SU stands for Switch User. SU let's you run a sub-shell with the 
priviledges of another user within your current shell.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Basic usage: suppose you know 
someone else's password, whether he gave it to you or you hacked his account. 
Simply type "su user password" (without the quotes), and replace user with this 
person's username, and replace password with his/her password.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>For root access: if 
no account is provided (just su and a single parameter. For example: "su blah"), 
your system assumes that you want to su to root, and checks if this is root 
password. If you entered the correct password, you get root access (unless the 
admin played around with the password file and <A

root false permissions</A>. In such a case, simply <A

passwords</A>)).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>When su'ing from root: 
remember that if you have root priviledges, nothing is supposed to stop you. So 
why would you need to have someone's password just to switch to his/her user? 
Simply type "su username" (without the quotes) to login as that 
user.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>When su'ing to a passwordless user: type "su username -" (without the 
quotes).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT

the sub-shell and return to your normal shell.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT

shadow file?: first of all, if you don't know what the shadow file is, read <A

Now, su is an SUID-root program. This is why it can read the shadow file, which

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1><I>A nifty usage</I> 
: most systems will block remote root logins, so people won't be able to get 
root even if they know root's password. But, if you know someone else's 
password, you could login as this user, get a shell and type "su 
root's-password" (without the quotes, of course).</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;

Here, let me explain.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Now, as you should know by 
now, every program or command you execute runs with YOUR priviledges. Right? 
WRONG!</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>SUID files can be run with the priviledges of the person who SUIDed 
them. You see, when you SUID a program, it puts your user ID somewhere inside 
the program so the system will know to run it with the SUIDer's priviledges. Of 
course, if you have root access, this should not trouble you, because you 
already have maximum priviledges.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>SUID programs also pose a 
great security threat, especially SUID-root programs. If someone finds a way to 
make these programs do something they shouldn't do, he can do it with root 
priviledges. For example: if you could make an SUID-root program execute a 
command for you, you could tell it to execute sh to run a Bourne Shell (or BASH 
for Bourne Again Shell, CSH for C Shell, TCSH for Turbo C Shell, KSH for Korn 
Shell etc') with root priviledges (or in other words, a root 
shell).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT

<P><A name="What are Linux runlevels"></A><B><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#ffffff><FONT size=-1>What are 
Linux runlevels?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>If you've been paying 
attention to what your Linux box does during startup, you should have noticed 
that it says: "Entering runlevel x" (where x is a number between 1 and 5) at one 
point of the bootup stage (after it mounts your root filesystem (your "/" 
directory) into read-write mode, sets up sound, finds your kernel's module 
dependencies (never mind that for now) etc'). A runlevel is a bootup/shutdown 
sequence. It consists of a list of commands to run on startup and a list of 
commands to run on shutdown (or when switching to different 
runlevels).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Now, first of all, let's see how you can switch runlevels. Bah, that's 
easy. Simply type init x, where x is a number between 0 and 6. Runlevel 0 is for 
"halt" (turning off your computer, if you have APM -Advanced Power Management, 
and if you have APMD - APM Daemon, installed. All modern CPUs have APM), 
runlevel 6 is for reboot and the rest are various runlevels. 5 will bootup 
everything - it will even automatically run X (by default, of course. You can 
change this). Runlevel 1 is considered the single-mode runlevel. It does the 
least possible (kinda like "safe mode" in Windows) and doesn't even require you 
to enter a password (but only root can switch runlevels, so you have to be 
either root or have physical access to the computer during startup (we'll get to 
that later)).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Editing your runlevels list is different with every different 
distribution. Usually it would go like this:</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>a) Go to /etc/rc.d/rcx.d/ 
(where x is the runlevel's number) and play around within this directory. It 
contains symbolic links (kinda like shortcuts in Windows. For more information 
about symbolic links (otherwise known as "symlinks"), type man ln) to programs 
(including their parameters) that will be executed, and symbolic links to 
programs that will be killed on shutdown. Play around to find out more (but 
ALWAYS make backups!!).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>You can also try 
this:</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>b) (this should work on most Linux boxes) Switch to the runlevel you 
want to edit. Then type setup. Go to system services, and select/unselect the 
services u want to run on startup and kill on shutdown).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Or this:</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>c) The easiest way - 
on some distributions, such as RedHat, you will be able to type the command 
control-panel within an xterm (a "virtual terminal" - a console window within 
X-Windows) and get a nice little window thingi with lots of buttons and 
suchlikes. Find the button that says "runlevel editor" when you put the mouse 
above it for a second or two. Then click on this button and play around with the 
programs. I'm sure you'll figure out how to use it yourself. It's quite 
self-explanitory, and it contains help files and documentation if you really 
need help.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Anyway, you can always try running the command:</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>find / -name *rc* 
-print</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>If none of the three specified methods didn't work, so you could see 
where your runlevel directories are and apply method a on them.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>And now, for a nice 
little runlevels-related hack.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Now, if you're reading this 
document, you're probably a Linux newbie, so you probably use Redhat Linux, 
Mandrake Linux etc'. If so, you should have a prompt saying "boot:" or "LILO 
boot:" or "LILO:" when you start your computer, and you could either type 
Windows or Linux (you can change these names into, say, sucky-OS for Windows and 
Stable_and_secure_OS for Linux, or anything else you want. Use the linuxconf 
program to edit LILO's preferences, and use your imagination...&nbsp; :-) ). 
Now, what happens if you type linux 5? Of course! It boots up Linux in runlevel 
5!! But wait! What happens if you type linux 1 or linux single? It runs on 
runlevel 1 - single user mode, which means... automatic root access! No password 
needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; :-)</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Of course, you can change 
runlevel 1 by going to /etc/rc.d/rc1.d and then removing the contents of this 
directory and copying everything from another runlevel (replace the number in 
rc1.d to any other runlevel number). Please read cp's manual page and make sure 
you're copying symbolic links as links and not as files.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Of course, anyway, if you have 
local access to a Unix box (or any other box that I know of, as a matter of 
fact), you can boot from a floppy (unless, of course, the first boot device is a 
hard drive and the bios is password-protected, but these can be hacked too.

face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#ffffff><FONT size=-1>What are 
Winmodems, and why do they suck? + Getting online with a WinModem from 
Unix/Linux</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>First of all, what is a MODEM 
anyway? The initials modem stand for modulator/demodulator. To make a long story 
short, a modem translates digital signals which your computer sends it into 
signals that can be transferred through the phone line (if it's a cable modem or 
some other kind of modem, it'll translate computer signals into whatever signals 
that can be transferred through the communications line it is supposed to run 
on), and then receives back phone signals and translates them into bits and 
bytes your computer can read and understand.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Note: of course, your modem 
does more than that. For example: it provides the actual connection with the 
phone line, and quite a variety of other things which are currently unimportant 
to us.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>This whole modulating (turning computer signals into phone signals) and 
demodulating (duh... the opposite of modulating. Turning phone signals into 
computer signals) process requires some software, and of course, a computer to 
run it. So your modem actually contains a little computer that does the 
modulating and demodulating.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Then what is a Winmodem? A 
Winmodem is a modem that does not do the modulating and demodulating thing. 
Instead, it leaves it up to your computer to do that. It comes with the software 
necessary for your computer to perform these convertions.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>So why do they suck 
so much? Because:</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>a) This whole convertion 
process takes up some resources from your computer, such as memory and CPU 
time.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>b) If your computer slows down for some reason, you might get 
disconnected all of a sudden.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>c) They don't run on any 
version of Unix. Why? Simply because there is no Winmodem software for Unix. The 
vendor didn't bother making them, I assume (silly bunch of lamers...&nbsp; :-) 
).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>So 
why would a person want to buy a Winmodem? Simply because they cost less (I 
guess you could figure out why at this point).</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Later addition: You 
can now go online from Linux with a WinModem! Check out <A

face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Once upon a time, in times 
when people either used versions of Windows prior to 95 or didn't use Windows at 
all (see <A href="http://blacksun.box.sk/hod.txt">the history of DOS paper</A>), 
there was a utility called undelete. It served as a recovery tool for deleted 
files that were deleted less than a week ago, and used to save a lot of work and 
tears. That was all nice and smooth, until Windows 95 came up with it's "recycle 
bin".</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Wow, looky here! Whenever I delete a file, it goes straight to the 
recycle bin! Ooh, I'd bet that's new...</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The recycle bin isn't some 
magical bin thing, it's just a hidden directory. On every Windows 95 or above 
hard-drive, you have a directory called recycled. Whenever you send a file to 
the recycle bin, it is actually moved to this directory. Sophisticated, isn't 
it?</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>But here's the problem: most people don't like the recycle bin. They 
either press shift+delete to delete files without transferring them through the 
recycle bin or empty the recycle bin right after they send a file to it. But 
then, when you realize that you've made a mistake, you cannot recreate the file. 
Or is it so? ...</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>You can use DOS's undelete to 
recreate deleted files that were removed less than a week ago. If the file was 
on the recycle bin prior to it's "final and unrecoverable deletion" (yeah, 
right), you will find it in your recycled directory. Can't get any easier than 
this. Where to find the undelete.exe program? If its not in your Windows\Command 
directory then you will have to copy it from your Windows CD-ROM. Its in the directory
called: oldmsdos.</FONT></FONT>

file transfers, and much more. IRC bots can also be used in channel takeovers, 
as a bot is faster than a human being, and can therefore quickly take advantage 
of any possible holes or opportunities that may occur (the bot would usually 
succeed, unless the channel operators have faster bots).</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>But what is an IRC bot anyway? 
An IRC bot is a program, usually programmed in TCL, that was programmed to 
understand the IRC protocol (the same language that the IRC server and your IRC 
clients, such as mIRC and BitchX know and can communicate with) and react to 
certain situations. Let's take the simplest example of all: a greeting bot. 
Whenever someone joins the channel, the bot greets him by saying "Hello &lt;nick 
of new user&gt;". Bots are usually based on Eggdrop. If you want to learn more 
about how to make Eggdrop bots, consult <A 
href="http://blacksun.box.sk/tutorials.html">our Eggdrop bots 
tutorial</A>.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>To run a bot, you will need to host it on a computer that:</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>a) Can run TCL. Unix 
and all of it's variants can run TCL using a special library, that is often 
pre-installed on the system already. Other systems can run TCL, but only after a 
lot of effort in finding the right extenral programs (have you ever noticed how 
many utilities come with a single average Unix/Linux distribution? Now, have you 
ever noticed how little come with Windows? MS Paint? Bah).</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>b) Can run, operate 
and be online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so your bot will stay up all the 
time as well.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Wait, wait, wait! Still don't know what a shell account is? Consult <A 
href="http://blacksun.box.sk/tutorials.html">our shell accounts 
tutorial</A>.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Sounds like you're *not* looking for a free shell, like the ones 
nether.net gives when you telnet in and login as newuser. Free shell accounts 
will kill all of your processes once you log off, and will usually not let you 
have access to the TCL library.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>However, if you want a shell 
that'll let you run any of these bots, you will either need to buy a shell 
(check out <A 
href="http://www.bestshells.com/">http://www.bestshells.com/</A>)&nbsp; or hack 
into a shell owned by someone else. The latter is not recommended, since it is 
illegal (duh...). However, if you still want to do it, or know how it is done,

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Most Linux 
distributions these days use some sort of package system to manage software. 
For</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>example, Red Hat, S.u.S.E. and Caldera's OpenLinux all use the RPM 
package manager to install and</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>uninstall software. Debian 
Linux and Slackware also have their own package</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>management. In an ideal world, 
any piece of software you wanted to run on your</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Linux box would be available 
as a package for your distribution.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Unfortunately, this 
isn't the ideal world, and many users find themselves wanting to</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>download and use 
software which is distributed as source code, usually in a file</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>ending with the 
.tar.gz extension.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Looking for 
instructions? They're in this document. Beware: because of the nature of the 
task at hand,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>these steps aren't as specific as they really need to be for most 
newbies, nor are they easy to follow as</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>they're given. This process is 
not for the faint of heart!</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>You should already 
know how to download via Netscape or ftp. Be sure to understand where 
you've</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>saved your downloaded file and also how to visit that directory; if 
you're not able to do this yet, spend</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>some time learning about the 
Unix directory structure from your favorite Unix beginner's reader. 
If</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>you're having trouble already, you're better off doing some more study 
before trying to compile your</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>own software; the instructions 
here are basic, but newbies will still find themselves stretching to 
follow</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>along.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT color=#ffffff><FONT 
size=-1>What is .tar.gz? How about .tgz? And .tar.bz2?</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The .tar.gz format is 
similar in concept to the .zip format common in the Windows world. The .zip 
format</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>performs two functions: it allows many different files to be rolled into 
one single file for convenience, and</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>it compresses this single file 
for faster downloading (or space savings). In Linux, these two tasks 
are</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>performed by two separate commands: the tar command and the gzip 
command.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Files which end in 
the .tar.gz extension are the result of a two-step process. First, many files 
are rolled</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>into a single file using the tar (Tape ARchive) program, giving the 
resulting file a .tar extension. Next, the</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>.tar file is compressed using 
the gzip program, adding an additional .gz extension to the end of the 
file.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Sometimes .tar.gz is abbreviated as .tgz to allow such files to exist on 
MS-DOS systems, which allow</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>only for a single, three 
character filename extension. In any case, .tar.gz or .tgz files are known 
as</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>"tarred-gzipped" files.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Files which end in 
the .tar.bz2 extension are similar to the .tar.gz files in that they are 
multiple files which</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>have been run through tar into 
a single file and then compressed. Files ending in .tar.bz2, however, 
are</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>compressed with the bzip2 compressor rather than the gzip compressor. To 
see if your Linux system</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>contains a bzip2 
compressor/decompressor, type "bunzip2 --help" at the command line. If you see 
a</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>25-line usage message, the utility is present on your 
system.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>How do I 'unpack' 
these files?</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Since there were two 
steps involved in creating these files, there two conceptual steps involved 
in</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>extracting them. Before we give you the easy way to extract these files, 
let's follow the conceptual</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>steps first. For our purposes, 
we'll assume that the file in question resides in your current 
working</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>directory. The first step is to decompress the file. If the file ends in 
.tgz, you'll need to rename it to a</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>.tar.gz file so that the gzip 
utility will recognize it:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; mv 
file_in_question.tgz file_in_question.tar.gz</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Then, depending on 
whether the file is a ".tar.gz" (.tgz) or ".tar.bz2" file, you'll need to use 
one of the</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>following commands:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; gunzip 
file_in_question.tar.gz</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; bunzip2 
file_in_question.tar.bz2</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Executing the proper 
command will decompress the file in question and remove the 
compressor's</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>extension from the file. The resulting file is named only with the .tar 
extension:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
file_in_question.tar</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>To extract all of the 
included files from this single file, make a new directory to hold the extracted 
files,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>go to that directory, and then use the tar command with the x (extract), 
v (verbose), and f (file is</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>specified next) 
options:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; mkdir 
downloaded</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>&nbsp; cd downloaded</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; tar xvf 
../file_in_question.tar</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Most .tar files will 
create another directory inside the directory you just created and extract their 
files</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>there. Some archives won't, however, so you'll need to watch carefully 
to see whether the extracted</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>files went into a 
subdirectory. Assuming that all of the above steps worked properly, your 
downloaded</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>archive file has been completely extracted. If the .tar file created its 
own directory when it was</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>extracted, you'll need to make 
it your current working directory before attempting to compile the</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>software:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; cd 
file_in_question_directory</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>More 'unpacking' 
Notes</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The Linux tar utility 
is actually more advanced that the standard Unix tar utility, and includes a 
significant</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>shortcut for extracting .tar.gz files. Instead of first using the gunzip 
utility to extract the file, you can have</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>the Linux tar utility do it 
for you by also specifying the z (zip/unzip) option:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; tar xzvf 
file_in_question.tgz</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; tar xzvf 
another_file_in_question.tar.gz</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>There are also a 
files out there (mainly from older Unix systems) which end with the .taz, .tar.Z 
or .tar.z</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>extensions. These files were created with the tar utility and the 
standard Unix compressor called (oddly</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>enough) "compress". The gzip 
utility in Linux also understands files compressed with the Unix</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>compress utility, so 
the following commands will all work fine:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; mv file_1.taz 
file_1.tar.z; gunzip file_1.tar.z</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; gunzip 
file_2.tar.Z</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>&nbsp; tar xzvf file_3.tar.Z</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; tar xzvf 
file_4.taz</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Note that this speedy 
method of unpacking (using the 'z' option) will not work with bzip or bzip2 
files,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>which end in .tar.bz or .tar.bz2. Such files will still need to be 
unpacked using the two-step process</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>given earlier.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Getting Ready to 
Compile</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Now that you're 
sitting in a directory full of files, it's time to generate software. This is 
done in two steps:</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>first, the source code must be 
"configured" for your system. Then, the make command must be run 
to</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>generate the actual machine code. Most extracted source archives these 
days allow for some sort of</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>"automatic" configuration. 
These will be the easiest for Linux newbies to compile and use. There are 
two</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>common types of automatic configuration: those using a GNU "configure" 
script and those using</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>something called an Imakefile. 
The "configure" script is preferable, so start by looking for a file 
called</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>"configure" in the directory containing the extracted files. If such a 
file exists, run it now:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
./configure</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>You'll see a long 
list of messages as the script attempts to analyze the makeup of your 
system.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Assuming the script exits without errors, you're ready to compile. If, 
on the other hand, no "configure"</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>script exists in the 
directory, but instead a file called "Imakefile" is present, you'll need to run 
the</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>"xmkmf" program to configure the source code:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
xmkmf</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>If this command 
finishes without errors, you may be ready to compile. Whichever method you 
use</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>(configure or xmkmf), if the process fails in a flurry of error 
messages, you're stuck for all intents and</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>purposes. Experts are often 
able to fix these sorts of problems, but the solutions would be Greek 
at</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>best to newbies, and methods for solving such problems are outside the 
scope of this article. You're</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>better off trying to find and 
install precompiled package.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Compiling</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The compilation 
process is generally simple, but time consuming. Type one word in the 
directory</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>containing the extracted files:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
make</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>A flurry of activity 
should follow; much of it will seem like technical gibberish. Linux is now 
"compiling"</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>the source code into binary code (a program) which can be executed. On 
very fast computers, very</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>small programs may compile in 
a matter of seconds. At the other extreme, on relatively slow</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>computers, large 
programs have been known to need days or even weeks of compilation time. 
The</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>process will proceed without need of your attention.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>There may be a number 
of warnings during the compilation process. These can usually be 
safely</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>ignored. If at any point the process abruptly aborts and displays a 
cryptic error message in any of a</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>number of forms, you're 
stuck:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; make: *** 
[init/main.o] Error 1</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>In cases like this, 
you should look for documentation such as plain text INSTALL or README 
files</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>included with the source code. These can be cryptic, but may contain 
additional instructions for</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>compilation. If you find and 
study such files, follow all instructions, and the compilation still fails, or 
if you</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>can't find any such INSTALL or README documentation files, you're again 
better off trying to find and</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>install a precompiled package 
for your system.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>When the process is 
complete, you will find yourself at the command line once again. Generally, if 
no</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>error messages (other than warnings) are obviously present, the 
compilation was successful, though</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>there can be exceptions to 
this rule. For our purposes, we'll assume that if you've got this far, 
your</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>download has compiled without problems.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Installing</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Most current source 
code allows for automatic installation using the make command a second 
time,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>making the "install" item:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; make 
install</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Note that you will 
generally need to be root to make the install, since it will try to install 
program binaries</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>into global binaries 
directories such as /bin, /usr/bin, or /usr/local/bin. With any luck, after 
entering this</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>command, you'll see the install process commence, as files are copied to 
various places throughout</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>your system. If you're 
interested in keeping a record of which files were installed where (in case, 
for</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>example, you wanted to "uninstall" this program later), you can keep a 
record of the install process in</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>some file on your 
system:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; make install 
2&gt;&amp;1 | tee /path/to/saved_log</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The created file 
simply contains text duplicating exactly what you saw on your screen (see the 
tee</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>manual page for more information). If the install method above fails 
with an error message, but the</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>compilation (completed 
earlier) was successful, you'll need to consult any included documentation 
in</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>INSTALL or README files to see how to install the binaries and other 
program files on your system.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>After the install has 
successfully run its course or you have consulted the necessary 
documentation</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>and followed included instructions, you may be able to execute the 
program just by typing its name at a</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>command prompt:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
myprog</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>If this isn't the 
case, review the install output and try to determine (using common sense and a 
little bit of</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>intelligent guesswork) if the file is going into either /usr/local/bin 
or /opt/bin. If it is, you may need to add</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>the directory to your PATH 
environment variable:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/opt/bin</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Now, try to execute 
the program again:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
myprog</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>If this doesn't work 
either, there may be additional complications. Consult the documentation which 
was</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>included with the source code. Such documentation usually resides in 
files called README, INSTALL,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>or in a directory called doc, 
and should give you more hints about using the program (and starting 
it)</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>once it's been installed.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>If adding directories

(Archive)</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Most Linux 
distributions these days use some sort of package system to manage software. 
For</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>example, Red Hat, S.u.S.E. and Caldera's OpenLinux all use the RPM 
package manager to install and</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>uninstall software. Debian 
Linux and Slackware also have their own package</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>management. In an ideal world, 
any piece of software you wanted to run on your</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Linux box would be available 
as a package for your distribution.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Unfortunately, this 
isn't the ideal world, and many users find themselves wanting to</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>download and use 
software which is distributed as source code, usually in a file</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>ending with the 
.tar.gz extension.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Looking for 
instructions? They're in this document. Beware: because of the nature of the 
task at hand,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>these steps aren't as specific as they really need to be for most 
newbies, nor are they easy to follow as</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>they're given. This process is 
not for the faint of heart!</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>You should already 
know how to download via Netscape or ftp. Be sure to understand where 
you've</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>saved your downloaded file and also how to visit that directory; if 
you're not able to do this yet, spend</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>some time learning about the 
Unix directory structure from your favorite Unix beginner's reader. 
If</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>you're having trouble already, you're better off doing some more study 
before trying to compile your</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>own software; the instructions 
here are basic, but newbies will still find themselves stretching to 
follow</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>along.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>What is .tar.gz? How 
about .tgz? And .tar.bz2?</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The .tar.gz format is 
similar in concept to the .zip format common in the Windows world. The .zip 
format</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>performs two functions: it allows many different files to be rolled into 
one single file for convenience, and</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>it compresses this single file 
for faster downloading (or space savings). In Linux, these two tasks 
are</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>performed by two separate commands: the tar command and the gzip 
command.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Files which end in 
the .tar.gz extension are the result of a two-step process. First, many files 
are rolled</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>into a single file using the tar (Tape ARchive) program, giving the 
resulting file a .tar extension. Next, the</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>.tar file is compressed using 
the gzip program, adding an additional .gz extension to the end of the 
file.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Sometimes .tar.gz is abbreviated as .tgz to allow such files to exist on 
MS-DOS systems, which allow</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>only for a single, three 
character filename extension. In any case, .tar.gz or .tgz files are known 
as</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>"tarred-gzipped" files.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Files which end in 
the .tar.bz2 extension are similar to the .tar.gz files in that they are 
multiple files which</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>have been run through tar into 
a single file and then compressed. Files ending in .tar.bz2, however, 
are</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>compressed with the bzip2 compressor rather than the gzip compressor. To 
see if your Linux system</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>contains a bzip2 
compressor/decompressor, type "bunzip2 --help" at the command line. If you see 
a</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>25-line usage message, the utility is present on your 
system.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>How do I 'unpack' 
these files?</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Since there were two 
steps involved in creating these files, there two conceptual steps involved 
in</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>extracting them. Before we give you the easy way to extract these files, 
let's follow the conceptual</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>steps first. For our purposes, 
we'll assume that the file in question resides in your current 
working</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>directory. The first step is to decompress the file. If the file ends in 
.tgz, you'll need to rename it to a</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>.tar.gz file so that the gzip 
utility will recognize it:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; mv 
file_in_question.tgz file_in_question.tar.gz</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Then, depending on 
whether the file is a ".tar.gz" (.tgz) or ".tar.bz2" file, you'll need to use 
one of the</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>following commands:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; gunzip 
file_in_question.tar.gz</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; bunzip2 
file_in_question.tar.bz2</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Executing the proper 
command will decompress the file in question and remove the 
compressor's</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>extension from the file. The resulting file is named only with the .tar 
extension:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
file_in_question.tar</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>To extract all of the 
included files from this single file, make a new directory to hold the extracted 
files,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>go to that directory, and then use the tar command with the x (extract), 
v (verbose), and f (file is</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>specified next) 
options:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; mkdir 
downloaded</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>&nbsp; cd downloaded</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; tar xvf 
../file_in_question.tar</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Most .tar files will 
create another directory inside the directory you just created and extract their 
files</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>there. Some archives won't, however, so you'll need to watch carefully 
to see whether the extracted</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>files went into a 
subdirectory. Assuming that all of the above steps worked properly, your 
downloaded</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>archive file has been completely extracted. If the .tar file created its 
own directory when it was</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>extracted, you'll need to make 
it your current working directory before attempting to compile the</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>software:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; cd 
file_in_question_directory</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>More 'unpacking' 
Notes</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The Linux tar utility 
is actually more advanced that the standard Unix tar utility, and includes a 
significant</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>shortcut for extracting .tar.gz files. Instead of first using the gunzip 
utility to extract the file, you can have</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>the Linux tar utility do it 
for you by also specifying the z (zip/unzip) option:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; tar xzvf 
file_in_question.tgz</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; tar xzvf 
another_file_in_question.tar.gz</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>There are also a 
files out there (mainly from older Unix systems) which end with the .taz, .tar.Z 
or .tar.z</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>extensions. These files were created with the tar utility and the 
standard Unix compressor called (oddly</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>enough) "compress". The gzip 
utility in Linux also understands files compressed with the Unix</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>compress utility, so 
the following commands will all work fine:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; mv file_1.taz 
file_1.tar.z; gunzip file_1.tar.z</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; gunzip 
file_2.tar.Z</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>&nbsp; tar xzvf file_3.tar.Z</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; tar xzvf 
file_4.taz</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Note that this speedy 
method of unpacking (using the 'z' option) will not work with bzip or bzip2 
files,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>which end in .tar.bz or .tar.bz2. Such files will still need to be 
unpacked using the two-step process</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>given earlier.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Getting Ready to 
Compile</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Now that you're 
sitting in a directory full of files, it's time to generate software. This is 
done in two steps:</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>first, the source code must be 
"configured" for your system. Then, the make command must be run 
to</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>generate the actual machine code. Most extracted source archives these 
days allow for some sort of</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>"automatic" configuration. 
These will be the easiest for Linux newbies to compile and use. There are 
two</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>common types of automatic configuration: those using a GNU "configure" 
script and those using</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>something called an Imakefile. 
The "configure" script is preferable, so start by looking for a file 
called</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>"configure" in the directory containing the extracted files. If such a 
file exists, run it now:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
./configure</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>You'll see a long 
list of messages as the script attempts to analyze the makeup of your 
system.</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Assuming the script exits without errors, you're ready to compile. If, 
on the other hand, no "configure"</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>script exists in the 
directory, but instead a file called "Imakefile" is present, you'll need to run 
the</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>"xmkmf" program to configure the source code:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
xmkmf</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>If this command 
finishes without errors, you may be ready to compile. Whichever method you 
use</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>(configure or xmkmf), if the process fails in a flurry of error 
messages, you're stuck for all intents and</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>purposes. Experts are often 
able to fix these sorts of problems, but the solutions would be Greek 
at</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>best to newbies, and methods for solving such problems are outside the 
scope of this article. You're</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>better off trying to find and 
install precompiled package.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Compiling</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The compilation 
process is generally simple, but time consuming. Type one word in the 
directory</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>containing the extracted files:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
make</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>A flurry of activity 
should follow; much of it will seem like technical gibberish. Linux is now 
"compiling"</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>the source code into binary code (a program) which can be executed. On 
very fast computers, very</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>small programs may compile in 
a matter of seconds. At the other extreme, on relatively slow</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>computers, large 
programs have been known to need days or even weeks of compilation time. 
The</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>process will proceed without need of your attention.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>There may be a number 
of warnings during the compilation process. These can usually be 
safely</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>ignored. If at any point the process abruptly aborts and displays a 
cryptic error message in any of a</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>number of forms, you're 
stuck:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; make: *** 
[init/main.o] Error 1</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>In cases like this, 
you should look for documentation such as plain text INSTALL or README 
files</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>included with the source code. These can be cryptic, but may contain 
additional instructions for</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>compilation. If you find and 
study such files, follow all instructions, and the compilation still fails, or 
if you</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>can't find any such INSTALL or README documentation files, you're again 
better off trying to find and</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>install a precompiled package 
for your system.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>When the process is 
complete, you will find yourself at the command line once again. Generally, if 
no</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>error messages (other than warnings) are obviously present, the 
compilation was successful, though</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>there can be exceptions to 
this rule. For our purposes, we'll assume that if you've got this far, 
your</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>download has compiled without problems.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>Installing</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Most current source 
code allows for automatic installation using the make command a second 
time,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>making the "install" item:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; make 
install</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>Note that you will 
generally need to be root to make the install, since it will try to install 
program binaries</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>into global binaries 
directories such as /bin, /usr/bin, or /usr/local/bin. With any luck, after 
entering this</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>command, you'll see the install process commence, as files are copied to 
various places throughout</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>your system. If you're 
interested in keeping a record of which files were installed where (in case, 
for</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>example, you wanted to "uninstall" this program later), you can keep a 
record of the install process in</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>some file on your 
system:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; make install 
2&gt;&amp;1 | tee /path/to/saved_log</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>The created file 
simply contains text duplicating exactly what you saw on your screen (see the 
tee</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>manual page for more information). If the install method above fails 
with an error message, but the</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>compilation (completed 
earlier) was successful, you'll need to consult any included documentation 
in</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>INSTALL or README files to see how to install the binaries and other 
program files on your system.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>After the install has 
successfully run its course or you have consulted the necessary 
documentation</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT 
size=-1>and followed included instructions, you may be able to execute the 
program just by typing its name at a</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>command prompt:</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>&nbsp; 
myprog</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>If this isn't the

little bit of</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT

or /opt/bin. If it is, you may need to add</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT

myprog</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>If this doesn't work 
either, there may be additional complications. Consult the documentation which 
was</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT

files called README, INSTALL,</FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=-1>or in a directory called doc,

the Procurement Guideline Series, is written to help facilitate the acquisition 
of trusted computer systems in accordance with DoD 5200.28-STD, Department of 
Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria. It is designed for new or 
experienced automated information system developers, purchasers, or program 
managers who must identify and satisfy requirements associated with 
security-relevant acquisitions. Volume 2 addresses the way by which trusted 
computer system evaluation criteria are translated into language for use in the 
Request for Proposal Specifications and Statements of Work.
<P>Information contained within the Procurement Guideline Series will facilitate 
subsequent development of procurement guidance for the "Federal Criteria." This 
series also includes information being developed for certification and 
accreditation guidance.
<P>The business of computers, security, and acquisitions is complex and dynamic. 
As the Director, National Computer Security Center, I invite your 
recommendations for revision to this technical guideline. Our staff will work to 
keep this guideline current. However, experience of users in the field is the 
most important source of timely information. Please send comments and 
suggestions to:

</PRE>DoD Directive 5200.28, Security Requirements for Automated Information 
Systems (AISs), provides security requirements concerning all protection aspects 
of automated information systems. It specifies DoD 5200.28-STD, DoD Trusted 
Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), as the requirement source for 
trusted computer systems. The second page of DoD 5200.28-STD states: "This 
document is used to provide a basis for specifying security requirements in 
acquisition specifications."
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.2   3 8">1.2 PURPOSE</A></H3>The intended user of the document 
is the "procurement initiator," to include Program Managers, users, and security 
managers. These individuals must write the Request for Proposal (RFP), 
specifically Section C; and the Specification and Statement of Work (SOW). 
Volume 1 of this guideline series discusses the responsibilities of different 
roles in procurement initiation. 
<P>The purpose of this document is to facilitate the contracting process, 
provide uniformity in competitive acquisitions, minimize procurement cost and 
risk, avoid delays in the solicitation process, and help ensure the solicitation 
is complete before its issuance.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.2.1   4 8">1.2.1 FACILITATING THE CONTRACTING PROCESS</ 
A></H4>This guideline provides Specification and Statement of Work contract 
language to procure a trusted system, hopefully satisfied by a product from the 
NSA Evaluated Product List (EPL). (Note: The EPL is found in the Information 
Systems Security Products and Services Catalogue.) This guideline does not 
address Government certification and accreditation tasks. The guideline is 
written to ensure the selected system will provide adequate security, while 
avoiding a costly solution. This document has no intent beyond the security 
aspects of the system.
<P>DoD agencies should use this document whenever considering the acquisition of 
trusted computer systems. System security requirements are provided in contract 
language for direct incorporation into an RFP. The language duplicates the words 
and intent of the TCSEC.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.2.2   4 9">1.2.2 FACILITATING FAIRNESS IN COMPETITIVE 
ACQUISITION</A></H4>The guidelines in this document support the procurement of 
EPL products and can only be implemented if the requirements for fair 
competition are satisfied. If these requirements have not been satisfied, the 
procurement can result in a protest and the selection may possibly be nullified. 
These requirements include:
<P>a. Public Law 98-369, "Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."
<P>b. Title 41, United States Code, Section 418, "Advocates for Competition."
<P>c. Title 10, United States Code, Section 2318, "Advocates for Competition."
<P>d. DoD Instruction 5000.2, Defense Acquisition Management Policy, February 
23, 1991, pp. 5-A-2 through 4.
<P>e. DoD 5000.2-M, Defense Acquisition Management Documentation and Reports, 
February, 1991, p. 4-D-1-3 d.(1).
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.2.3   4 9">1.2.3 MINIMIZING PROCUREMENT COST AND RISK</ 
A></H4>Version 1 of this procurement guideline series is written solely to 
acquire products on the EPL, that is, to enable the procurement initiator to 
obtain those EPL products available for integration into an application, as 
opposed to developing a system through specification.
<P>For solutions that use EPL products, not only have the specifications of the 
evaluated Division/Class been satisfied, but the assurance tasks have been 
completed and the required documentation produced. Certification evidence, 
analyses, and operational documents previously produced for an NSA evaluation 
may be available to ensure trustworthiness and used directly for certification 
and satisfaction of required proposal and contract data. The results are less 
development risk and a lower overall cost to the bidder and, consequently, to 
the Government.
<P>For a defined entity of a system to be regarded as secure in the TCSEC sense 
means that, at a minimum, all of the requirements of some specified TCSEC 
Division/Class must be met. This is discussed further in Volume 1, Chapter 3. To 
call that entity, for example, a Class B2 entity, would require NSA evaluation 
as a product satisfying the Class B2 criteria. (This convention has evolved over 
the past several years so that products would not be misrepresented in their 
evaluation status.)
<P>A successful certification evaluation of an entity (which has not been placed 
on the NSA EPL) can only state that evaluation and approval have been completed 
as part of a certification process against the Class B2 set of requirements.
<P>The rationale for this approach is as follows:
<P>a. Although a Division/Class of the TCSEC is used as the basis for the secure 
part of a system, the procurement and build process can introduce new, 
conflicting requirements and relax, reinterpret, or change the intent of some of 
the existing TCSEC requirements. Only an exact evaluation can determine this.
<P>b. The certification evaluation process addresses the needs of a single 
implementation. It has generally not experienced the finely honed expertise of 
the NSA evaluation process and personnel and does not have the same assurance 
for additional applications as does an EPL product.
<P>If there are fewer than five items on the EPL meeting the stated requirements 
(not just security requirements), the RFP will not dictate that an item come 
from the EPL. Also, the process for placement on the EPL is itself a restricted, 
Government controlled process. To state such a requirement in the RFP would 
constitute a discrimination against other vendors desiring to bid. It also 
cannot be stated that, for example, "a B2 system is required" because that 
implies the solution must be taken from the EPL. Therefore, the specific TCSEC 
requirements necessary to meet a certain Division/Class rating must be spelled 
out, without stating that the B2 product is desired. However, the desire for 
decreased risk and cost (common to EPL products) is normally a strong factor for 
source selection.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.2.4   4 10">1.2.4 ENSURING THE SOLICITATION IS COMPLETE BEFORE 
ISSUANCE</A></H4>If we try to use the TCSEC criteria as RFP requirements in 
existent form, it is found that those TCSEC criteria are not presented in the 
same form and order required by the RFP. The TCSEC mixes system specifications, 
work statements and products to be delivered. This guideline organizes the TCSEC 
requirements into an RFP format. 
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.3   3 10">1.3 SCOPE</A></H3>This guideline reformates and 
reorders the requirements into a form suitable for use in contractual documents 
and does not revise the words in DoD 5200.28- STD. This document might be 
thought of as an adaptation of the TCSEC for procurement. Procurement 
considerations are documented within the guideline to advise the procurement 
initiator of factors that may influence procurement decisions, including cost 
control. All of the factors are addressed as possible augmentations to the 
specification language provided. 
<P>This set of four acquisition documents is not to be misunderstood as DoD 
policy when it comes to addressing the situation of acquiring complex systems 
composed of many heterogeneous components. The reason is that the DoD policy has 
not been finalized that addresses systems with combinations of EPL products and 
"built and certified" system entities, which may or may not use Division/Class 
criteria as requirements from DoD 5200.28- STD.
<P>What will be required for more complicated systems will be a policy for 
integrating entities, to include determining interface requirements and global 
policies to be supported across entities. As soon as these composition policies 
are issued by the DoD, this guideline series will be updated to reflect policy 
changes. In the meantime, for Program Managers faced with the more complicated 
situations not currently dealt with in this series, it is hoped that the 
principles of these guidelines can be extrapolated, using guidance from the

<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.4   3 11">1.4 BACKGROUND</A></H3>A Federal Government 
awareness of the lack of guidance in the security arena led to the formation of 
the DoD Computer Security Evaluation Center (later the National Computer 
Security Center). The Trusted Product Evaluation Program (TPEP) was started to 
provide an "independent laboratory" assessment of commercial products.
<P>The TCSEC was published in 1983 and revised to become a DoD standard in 
December 1985 to provide criteria for evaluating security features and assurance 
requirements available in "trusted, commercially available, automatic data 
processing systems."
<P>The process for acquiring trusted systems is slightly different than other 
acquisitions. The major differences are that 1) the security requirements may 
become a major constraining factor in determining the solution needed to meet 
the remaining requirements and 2) there exists a void of acquisition guidance 
for AIS security.
<P>The challenge for the procurement initiator is to specify the requirements 
with sufficient clarity and flexibility to achieve the desired security 
functions without limiting the ingenuity and ability of the offerors to supply a 
compliant overall solution.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR2   2 11">2 PROCUREMENT PROCESS</A></H2>The procurement process 
is governed by policy. Here three types of policy are distinguished. The first 
kind of policy is referred to simply as security policy or regulatory policy. 
This is security policy that applies to all DoD systems, personnel, and 
operations. Next, computer security policy or COMPUSEC policy is represented by 
the Division/Class criteria in the TCSEC. Finally, operational security policy 
is that security policy associated with a given application including range of 
classifications, range of clearances, categories, mode, and other specific 
operational security decisions that are made. Operational security policy 
determines which Division/Class should be used.
<P>The procurement process begins with various Government personnel determining 
operational requirements. Personnel include, but are not limited to, mission 
users, Program Managers, and acquisition representatives. The primary goals 
during this phase include determining the Division/Class and mode of operation, 
as well as identifying the required security features and assurances.
<P>Selection of these security specifications requires a clear understanding of 
the system users' operational and mission needs, the relevant DoD security 
policies, available technologies, and the system's operational environment. 
Procurement initiators and offerors must also consider the security--related 
areas listed in Figure 2-1 below. More detailed information concerning these 
security areas can be found in DoD 5200.1-R, DoD Directive 5200.28, and DoD 
5200.28-M.
<P>Physical Security
<P>Communications Security
<P>Procedural Security
<P>Emission Security
<P>Personnel Security
<P>The Designated Approving Authority (DAA) is responsible under Enclosure 4 of 
DoD Directive 5200.28 to determine the minimum AIS computer--based security 
requirements for the mission profile of the system being acquired. Any 
adjustments to computer security evaluation Division/Class (per step 6 of 
enclosure 4) will have been completed prior to using this guideline. The 
Division/Class that results from this assessment may be changed based on other 
factors considered by the DAA. The final Division/Class assigned to the system 
will be used to isolate the appropriate section of the evaluation criteria in 
the TCSEC, (which is organized by Division/Class).
<P>Later in Chapter 5 of this document, we will address specific protection 
topics in the TCSEC. The paragraph will be used that corresponds to the 
Division/Class being supported in this procurement. Chapter 5 will identify both 
Division/Class and the corresponding TCSEC paragraph number to assist the 
procurement initiator in construction of the RFP.
<P>Working with acquisition personnel, the procurement initiators should consult 
this guideline using the Division/Class selected for the system. The 
specification language contained in or referenced by this guideline can be 
applied directly to selected features and assurances. The statements can be 
amplified to meet specific operational requirements. Procurement initiators and 
acquisition personnel must ensure that the security specifications and work 
statements in Section C of the RFP allow EPL solutions, do not preclude other 
solutions, and are compliant with the DAA's accreditation requirements. NSA is 
eager to help in this determination. The requirements of the TCSEC will be 
carried through the development life cycle of the system: RFP, contract, test, 
certification, and accreditation. 
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR3   2 13">3 REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</A></H2>The RFP is the focus of 
this procurement guideline series. A standard RFP has thirteen sections, each 
designated by a letter of the alphabet (see Table 2). The procurement initiator 
provides input to and review of all of these sections. The majority of the 
procedural information is controlled directly by the procurement activity. 
Security relevant sections important to the procurement initiator and addressed 
in the remainder of this document are highlighted.

</PRE>
<H3><A name="HDR3.1   3 13">3.1 SECTION C - DESCRIPTIONS/SPECIFICATIONS</ 
A></H3>The first part of Section C describes the technical requirements to the 
offeror, including the security requirements. The section is mission user- 
oriented, and will normally contain a Specification or Requirements section that 
lays out the features and capabilities to included in the system to satisfy 
mission security requirements. The guideline has consolidated the security 
functionality requirements of the TCSEC. This will be addressed in detail in 
Chapter 5.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.2   3 14">3.2 SECTION C - STATEMENTS OF WORK (SOW)</A></ H3> 
The second part of Section C identifies the specific tasks the contractor will 
perform during the contract period and include security related tasking. The SOW 
could include tasks such as system engineering, design, and build. For security, 
Statements of Work include contractor tasking necessary to achieve specific 
levels of assurance, including studies and analyses, configuration management, 
security test and evaluation support, delivery, and maintenance of the trusted 
system. These work statements also specify the development of the required 
documentation to be provided under the Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs). 
This will be addressed in detail in Chapter 5.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.3   3 14">3.3 SECTION F - DELIVERIES AND PERFORMANCE</A></ H3> 
This section covers delivery and installation requirements. Special delivery 
requirements, as specified in the TCSEC, need to be included. Performance 
requirements for the trusted system will also be discussed. This section will be 
addressed further in Chapter of the guideline.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.4   3 14">3.4 SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</ 
A></H3>This section of the solicitation contains clauses that are specially 
tailored for each acquisition. Typical topics covered include: site access and 
preparation, data rights, maintenance, liquidated damages, and training 
responsibilities. Although these are not addressed specifically in this 
guideline, they are often topics of concern to the procurement initiator of 
trusted systems.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.5   3 14">3.5 SECTION J - LIST OF DOCUMENTS, EXHIBITS AND 
OTHER ATTACHMENT</A></H3>This section contains a list of documents, exhibits, 
attachments, and other forms used to build and execute the RFP. There are 
usually a series of attachments, each one dedicated to a list of specific items. 
Attachments addressed by this guideline series include the following:
<P>a. The Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). It references specific Data 
Item Description (DID) requirements, which are provided in Volume 3 of the 
Procurement Guideline Series and also are referenced in RFP Attachment A 
contained in Chapter 5. Each SOW task is linked to one or more CDRLs; each CDRL 
identifies a document or other data that the offeror is required to deliver, 
along with specific information about that document (e.g. schedule, number and 
frequency of revisions, distribution). Associated with each CDRL is a DID that 
specifies the document's content and format. Where requirements differ, there 
are unique DIDs for each Division/Class.
<P>b. Glossary. Even though it is presented separately, the glossary is an 
important part of the specifications and the Statements of Work because it 
precisely defines terms and further clarifies the language intent. The glossary 
is included as RFP Attachment B in Chapter 5 of this guideline.
<P>c. Acronyms. Acronyms used in the RFP must be defined in their first us and 
must also be identified in the accompanying acronym list. Acronyms are included 
as RFP Attachment C in Chapter 5 of this guideline.
<P>d. References. References have been identified for incorporation into the 
RFP. Terms support and are compatible with the specification language, and as 
such, become an integral part. The references are for technical supporting 
information and should not be interpreted as requirements. References are 
included as RFP Attachment D Chapter 5 of this guideline. 
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.6   3 15">3.6 SECTION L - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND 
NOTICES TO OFFERORS</A></H3>This section contains the instructions and 
conditions of the acquisition. It informs offerors of their actions and 
responsibilities, if they are planning to submit a proposal. It covers such 
things as proposal format, oral presentations, and the proposal preparation 
instructions. Proposal preparation instructions can be used to an advantage by 
requiring the offerors to submit outlines of how they will conduct SOW tasking. 
This will assist in understanding the offeror's technical approach and allow 
assessment of their understanding of the technical requirements. This will be 
addressed in detail in Chapter 5 of this guideline.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.7   3 15">3.7 SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</ 
A></H3>This presents to the bidder the basis of award and how proposals will be 
evaluated. It should be taken from the Government's proposal evaluation 
criteria, addressed in Volume 4 of this guideline series.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR4   2 15">4 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</A></H2>There are other 
important factors to consider before the RFP language is presented.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.1   3 15">4.1 NONMANDATORY REQUIREMENTS AND OPTIONS</A></ H3> 
An alternative for procurement initiators is to specify nonmandatory 
requirements. These requirements are placed in the RFP. The bidder may respond 
to these requirements or choose not to respond. The bidder will not be penalized 
for not responding or for proposing an unacceptable response. The bidder can, 
however, gain points if the approach is deemed acceptable by the evaluators.
<P>Nonmandatory requirements and solutions can also be proposed by the bidder if 
this is allowed by the RFP. Again bidders will not be penalized for not 
proposing nonmandatory requirements, for proposing unacceptable requirements, 
for proposing unacceptable solutions, or for proposing unacceptable desirable 
options or features. They can gain points by proposing acceptable solutions to 
acceptable requirements, whether these requirements become part of the contract 
or not.
<P>Options are requirements that may be proposed by the Government, but that are 
not necessarily intended to be purchased at the same time as the rest of the 
features. The Government may still want these options addressed in the proposal 
and evaluated as if they were mandatory requirements.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.2   3 16">4.2 EVIDENCE AVAILABILITY</A></H3>Though a vendor 
supplies NSA with evidence to support a product evaluation, the Government does 
not necessarily have rights to that documentation. In order to obtain 
certification evidence, even the identical documents provided for product 
evaluation, the Government must task the development of the documentation in the 
Statement of Work and delivery in the CDRL. Of course, only that documentation 
that is required for certification and operation should be specified.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.3   3 16">4.3 DOCUMENTATION COST</A></H3>The cost for 
operational security documentation (e.g. Security Feature User's Guide and 
Trusted Facility Manual) can be incurred within the contract or directly by the 
Government. A contract cost is incurred if the operational security 
documentation is specifically called out in the RFP and therefore generated to 
Government standards by the offeror. The cost would be incurred directly by the 
Government if the acquiring agency Program Manager intends to develop the 
documentation internally. This makes the system appear less expensive. 
Unfortunately, users seldom have the experience and expertise necessary to 
generate this unique type of documentation. This can lead to cost growth 
manifested in contract Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs).
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.4   3 16">4.4 INTERPRETING THE TCSEC</A></H3>The philosophy of 
this document is to present the words of the TCSEC and then place the 
responsibility for changes in the hands of the procurement initiator, all the 
while warning of the pitfalls. The best approach is for the initiator to propose 
changes and have them reviewed by NSA, or some other equivalent security 
organization, to assess impact. Care must be taken not to restrict potentially 
valid solutions when writing the specification or Statement of Work sections of 
the RFP.
<P>The features and assurances for a given TCSEC Division/Class are inseparable. 
If requirements or taskings are eliminated from a specific level of trust, then 
that level cannot be certified. If requirements are added, existing EPL 
solutions could be eliminated.
<P>The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is the totality of protection mechanisms, 
hardware, software and/or firmware, the collection of which is responsible for 
enforcing security. The TCB is the trusted part, but not necessarily the total, 
of the offeror's solution.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR5   2 17">5 STANDARD SOLICITATION LANGUAGE</A></H2>To assist the 
reader, the paragraph numbering that follows is as one might expect to find it 
in the RFP. This chapter identifies the language to be used in the RFP.
<P>Certain conventions are used in this chapter. The words in bold are either 
words intended for use in the RFP or references to words intended for use in the 
RFP. For example, bold paragraphs normally reference specific paragraphs of DoD 
5200.28-STD that are suggested for use verbatim in the RFP document. Paragraphs 
applicable to only a Division/Class range will have that range in parentheses 
prior to the paragraph or group of paragraphs. Paragraphs in which the 
Division/Class are absent are applicable to all Divisions/Classes (C2-- A1).
<P>Topics in Section C are divided into paragraphs as follows:
<P>a. <U>Text of the Specification or Statement of Work. These are words or 
references to words suggested for inclusion in the RFP.</U>
<P>b. <U>Important References. These references should be included in the RFP. 
They are generally guidelines intended to explain and interpret the TCSEC for 
the bidder. These references will be redundantly contained in the list of 
references accompanying the RFP. It is important to emphasize that even though 
these references are bold and will be contained in the RFP, they are not RFP 
requirements.</U>
<P>c. <U>Procurement Considerations. Here issues are discussed that have arisen 
in previous procurements or are apt to arise in future procurements. These 
issues should be considered by the procurement initiator in the context of 
his/her particular procurement to circumvent possible later contractual or 
certification problems. These considerations are not complete, but offer 
guidance based on known experiences. They are not in bold and therefore we do 
not automatically intend their inclusion in the RFP. Only if the procurement 
initiator decides to make them requirements will they be included in the 
RFP.</U>
<P>The standard language and form for the trusted elements of a secure system, 
along with important discussion, are provided in the remainder of this chapter, 
organized according to a subset of the sections of the RFP.

<P>NCSC-TG-003, A Guide to Understanding Discretionary Access Control in Trusted 
Systems, September 30, 1987.
<P>Discretionary Access Control Procurement Considerations
<P>Unauthorized users include both those not authorized to use the system and 
legitimate users not authorized to access a specific piece of information being 
protected.
<P>"Users" do not include "operators," "system programmers," "Security 
Officers," and other system support personnel. The latter are distinct from 
users and are subject to the Trusted Facility Management and the System 
Architecture requirements. 
<P>Deletion of subjects (e.g., users) and objects (e.g., data) is a potential 
problem. The mechanism should handle the deletion effectively, making certain 
that dangling references do not grant unintended access.
<P>The ability to assign access permissions to an object by a user should be 
controlled with the same precision as the ability to access the objects 
themselves. Four basic models for control exist: hierarchical, concept of 
ownership, laissez--faire, and centralized. These are discussed in NCSC-TG- 003.
<P>The TCB should enforce need--to--know access restrictions placed on 
information managed by the information system. The need--to--know access 
restrictions for the information, when created or changed, should be determined 
by the office of primary responsibility or the originator of the information. 
Only users determined to have appropriate clearances in addition to required 
"need-to-know" for information should be allowed to access the information. 
<P>The design must consider that discretionary access control is usually used 
for both user access control and system access control. For example, the system 
may contain several types of objects (known as public objects) that are designed 
to be read by all users, or executed by all users, but allowing only trusted 
subjects modification privileges.
<P>Discretionary access control will not stop Trojan horses. An attacker can 
trick a more privileged user to run a program containing a Trojan horse that in 
turn copies the user access files to the attackers address space. Trojan horses 
are addressed in NCSC-TG-003.
<P>The commercial--off--the--shelf (COTS) systems may vary with respect to the 
granularity of objects to which discretionary access control is applied. 
Generally, they are organized to provide discretionary access control (DAC) at 
the file level or at the application level. Database design can often handle the 
cases when a different level of granularity is desired by the procuring agency 
so that EPL products can apply. The procuring agency should take particular 
care, whenever possible, to write RFP specifications for DAC that can be met by 
at least some existing commercially available products. (This is further 
addressed in Volume 1, Chapter 3.)

<P><U>Labels Procurement Considerations</U>
<P>The tranquillity principle states that the security level of an object cannot 
change while the object is being processed by a system. The same can be stated 
about changes to security clearances. This is a critical area, both from the 
standpoint of changes only being invocable by an authorized individual under the 
direct control of the TCB and ensuring the system cannot be spoofed when such 
changes are being made.
<P>Labeling of data is not used solely to control classified information. The 
mandatory policy can also be used for unclassified sensitive or privacy 
applications.
<P>A distinction must be made between objects that are explicitly labeled and 
those that are implicitly labeled. For example, a labeled file may contain many 
tuples or records mediated by the reference monitor.
<P>Internal TCB variables that are not visible to untrusted subjects need not be 
labeled, provided they are not directly or indirectly accessible by subjects 
external to the TCB. However, it is important to understand that such internal 
variables can function as covert signalling channels when untrusted subjects are 
able to detect changes in these variables by observing system behavior.

<P>NCSC-TG-017, A Guide to Understanding Identification and Authentication in 
Trusted Systems, September 1, 1991.
<P>Identification and Authentication Procurement Considerations
<P>This subject is discussed in Volume 1, Chapter 3 of the Procurement Guideline 
Series.
<P>Technology has provided techniques and products that vary greatly in terms of 
reducing attack risk while satisfying these requirements. The procurement 
initiator should ensure that the solution that satisfies the requirements is 
also state--of--the--art in level of protection and consistent with the 
requirements of this particular application.
<P>To be effective, authentication mechanisms must uniquely and unforgeably 
identify an individual. Identification and authentication data is vulnerable to 
interception by an intruder interposed between a user and the TCB. Compromise 
may result from mishandling off--line versions of the data (e.g., backup files, 
fault induced system dumps, or listings). Even a one--way encrypted file can be 
compared with an encryption dictionary of probable authentication data, if the 
encryption algorithm and key are known.
<P>(Classes B1--A1) Authorizations include functional roles assigned to 
individuals. Most roles can only be occupied by one person at a time. A role has 
its own set of authorizations that are normally different than the 
authorizations given to the individuals who can assume the role. An individual 
should not be allowed to assume a role and operate as an individual at the same 
time.
<P>If passwords are to be used, an automatic password generator is strongly 
recommended. If users are allowed to pick their own specific authenticators, 
their behavior is stereotypical enough to permit guessing or reproducing. 
Password generators are available that have been endorsed by NSA and can be 
obtained as Government off--the--shelf items. 
<P>Password aging is an important consideration that can be enforced 
administratively or by the identification/authentication function.
<P>Smart cards and biometric approaches are effective, especially when they 
augment a password approach.
<P>Whenever the subject is an operating computer program (i.e., a process), that 
process shall be directly associated with just one individual user, i.e., the 
person being served by the process. If the process is a system--owned process 
(e.g., a background process such as a print spooler), the person associated with 
the process is generally considered to be the Security Officer, the System 
Administrator, or the operator who initiated the process. The security level and 
other subject data that can influence access decisions shall be within the range 
of personnel security clearances associated with the individual user.

<P>NCSC-TG-001, A Guide to Understanding Audit in Trusted Systems, June 1, 1988.
<P>Audit Procurement Considerations
<P>The option should exist that either some maximum of security related 
activities be audited or that the System Administrator select events to be 
audited based on overhead considerations.
<P>An audit control switch available to the System Administrator can allow 
selection of audit levels, but never to allow less than some required minimum as 
determined by the DAA. 
<P>A requirement exists that authorized personnel shall be able to read all 
events recorded on the audit trail. A selection option is required that may 
either be a preselection or a post selection option. The preselection option 
limits the audit data recorded. The post selection option reduces the data 
analyzed from that recorded.
<P>Switches and options must not violate the requirements and intent of the 
TCSEC.
<P>The audit information should be sufficient to reconstruct a complete sequence 
of security related events. Audit analysis tools can greatly enhance the 
efficiency of the audit control function for the System Administrator. (See 
NCSC-TG-001 for further discussion.)
<P>The capability should be provided to prevent System Administrator and 
Security Officer functions from turning off auditing or modifying those results. 

<P>Only the System Administrator or Security Officer should be able to select 
what is to be audited from other events.
<P>(Classes B3--A1) The requirement to "monitor the occurrence or accumulation 
of security auditable events that may indicate an imminent violation of security 
policy" is subject to interpretation. It is the topic of an entire subfield of 
security known as intrusion detection. The DAA must determine what is reasonable 
in the context of the particular application.
<P>(Classes B3--A1) "If the occurrence or accumulation of these security 
relevant events continues, the system shall take the least disruptive action to 
terminate the event." The approach taken is very application peculiar and the 
DAA must further specify the action to be taken.

<P>System Architecture Procurement Considerations
<P>"Domain" as used in the TCSEC refers to the set of objects a subject has the 
ability to access. It is, for example, the protection environment in which a 
process is executing. Domain is sometimes also called "context" or "address 
space."
<P>Protection granularity can be an issue. Finer granularity (e.g., a few bytes) 
is ideal for providing precise control (down to the byte or word level), but 
requires a significant amount of computer overhead to maintain. The trade--off 
usually made is to have coarser granularity (e.g., 1024 byte blocks) to reduce 
hardware complexity and retain acceptable performance. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 
of this guideline series.)
<P>An important consideration is sensitivity label mapping to protection domain 
mechanisms. Hardware features (usually called "keys") allow the TCB to associate 
specific hardware "registers" with the main memory areas (domains) they are 
protecting. There should be sufficient types and numbers of "registers" to 
ensure the number of sensitivity labels for information in the system can be 
adequately mapped. Common ways to achieve these capabilities are through 
"Descriptor Base Registers," "Bounds Registers," and "Virtual Memory Mapping 
Registers," although other approaches may also be used.
<P>Asynchronous events are not predictable (e.g., arrival of a message, the 
printer running out of paper, or communications link errors). Asynchronous event 
mechanisms are hardware features that handle the unpredictable, usually by 
"interrupting" the processor. Once interrupted, the processor then deals with 
the event. Interpretation of DoD 5200.28-STD will probably require hardware 
features that will cause the processor to recognize and respond to specific 
asynchronous events, such as "security policy violations" (in DoD 5200.28-STD 
phrasing, violations of the Simple Security Property or Star Property). Unless 
hardware features support these properties, software must interpret the results 
of every operation, causing a severe performance penalty. The penalty may come 
into conflict with mission performance requirements.

be used in the exploitation of known channels. Here it requires that some action 
be taken for correcting them. The procurement initiator should clearly specify

<P>Many of the statements in the security testing requirements are subject to 
interpretation, (e.g., "relatively resistant to penetration," "consistency with 
top level specifications," "no more than a few correctable flaws," and 
"reasonable confidence that few remain"). The procurement initiator in the RFP 
must attempt to convey in any manner possible what will be expected by the 
Government, not only in satisfying the security testing requirement, but in 
terms of meeting the certification evaluation. Similarly, in evaluation of the 
bidder's response to testing requirements of the RFP, the Government must be 
very careful to understand that the contractor understands what is required. As 
an example, there is a great advantage in identifying who will conduct the 
penetration analysis (B2 and above) and how the results of that penetration will 
be dealt with. A clear understanding must exist and be documented before an

<P><U>Section L Procurement Considerations</U>
<P>In procuring EPL products, a goal is to use as much of the existing 
documentation and certification evidence as possible in satisfaction of the 
requirements of the contract. Usually this data does not belong to the 
Government. Thus bidders are encouraged to seek out and attempt to buy or 
otherwise obtain existing documentation from the developing vendor in an attempt 
to reduce the cost and risk of the bid and ensuing contract. <U>This approach 
can also provide a significant competitive advantage for EPL solutions.</U>

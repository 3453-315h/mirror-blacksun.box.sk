<H2><A name="HDR 2 7">FOREWORD</A></H2>This guideline, volume 1 of 4 in the 
series, "A Guide to Procurement of Trusted Systems," is written to help 
facilitate the acquisition of trusted computer systems in accordance with DoD 
5200.28-STD, "Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation 
Criteria." It is designed for new or experienced automated information system 
developers, purchasers, or program managers who must identify and satisfy 
requirements associated with security-relevant acquisitions. Information 
contained within this series will facilitate subsequent development of 
procurement guidance for the Federal Criteria. This series also includes 
information being developed for certification and accreditation guidance. 
Finally, this introductory guideline addresses both the complex acquisition 
process and the many regulations, standards, and criteria to be satisfied in 
providing a secure system.
<P>There is a large body of national policy established in the form of 
regulations, directives, Presidential Executive Orders, and Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) Circulars that forms the basis for procedures to handle and 
process Federal information, particularly classified information. These are 
presented and discussed in Appendix A, "Historical Basis."
<P>The business of computers, security, and acquisitions is complex and dynamic. 
As the Director, National Computer Security Center, l invite your 
recommendations for revision to this technical guideline. Our staff will work to 
keep it current. However, experience of users in the field is the most important 
source of timely information. Please send comments and suggestions to;

<H3><A name="HDR1.1   3 11">1.1 <B></B>INTRODUCTION</A></H3><B></B>This document 
is a guideline designed for those who must identify and satisfy deliverable data 
requirements associated with security-relevant acquisitions of trusted, 
stand-alone systems. It identifies what must be complied with, what must be 
read, what must be written, and what others must be instructed to write. The 
detailed acquisition process, coupled with the technical complexity of 
computers, security, and contracting, represents an unsolvable mystery for many. 
The goal of this document is to help clarify the complex issues. 
<P>The National Security Agency (NSA) wants to clarify the computer security 
aspects of the Department of Defense (DoD) Automated Information System (AIS) 
acquisition process. Therefore, it is producing the guideline series (shown in 
Table 1-1), of which this document is the first.

<H3><A name="HDR1.2   3 11">1.2 DEFINITION OF TERMS</A></H3>National Computer 
Security Center (NCSC)-TG-004, "Glossary of Computer Security Terms," defines 
security terms used in this publication. DoD Instruction 5000.2, "Defense 
Acquisition Management Policies and Procedures," defines acquisition terms. DoD 
Instruction 5000.33, "Uniform Budget/Cost Terms and Definitions," defines budget 
terms.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.3   3 12">1.3 APPLICABILITY</A></H3>This guideline is for use 
by all DoD agencies. It applies to AlS developers purchasers, or program 
managers who deliver systems to customers. It specifically supports acquisitions 
of systems from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products on the Evaluated 
Products List (EPL).
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.4   3 12">1.4 PURPOSE</A></H3>Figure 1-1 shows how to use this 
document. The purpose of this document is to provide the Program Manager and the 
Security Manager a guide to the activities and the documentation in an 
acquisition of a secure system. This document will help those responsible to 
develop plans and procedures for acquisition of trusted, stand-alone systems. 
Specifically, it will help identify security-relevant data to be delivered by a 
contractor.

</P></PRE>The second in this series of documents provides a way to specify 
security requirements accurately in a standardized way, while complying with 
current acquisition regulations. The Government decides the split of 
responsibility between the Government and the Contractor. Once documents the 
contractor is required to write have been identified, a Data Item Description 
(DID) can be chosen from the third document in this series. If a document is not 
available, the third document will also help tailor an existing DID to create 
the desired DID. The fourth document in this series provides a guide to evaluate 
contractor proposals addressing computer security (COMPUSEC). The fourth 
guideline is intended for the procurement initiator, but will also be helpful to 
the contractor preparing his/her proposal.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.4.1   4 13">1.4.1 ASSUMPTIONS</A></H4>Most users will be 
building a Request for Proposal (RFP) and therefore will need to develop 
deliverable data packages. The security functional requirements must have been 
previously established.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.4.2   4 13">1.4.2 ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT OFFICE</A></H4>The 
people reading this document will most likely be assigned to a Program 
Management Office (PMO) or System Program Office (SPO). These organizational 
elements are responsible for managing acquisition activities. The PMO/SPO could 
be a several hundred person organization, or it could be just one person. In 
either case, the principles and concepts are basically the same; only the scale 
might change.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.5   3 13">1.5 SCOPE</A></H3>This set of four acquisition 
documents does not address the complex acquisition of multiple security entity 
systems. The reason is that the DoD policy has not been finalized that addresses 
systems with combinations of EPL products and "built and certified" system 
entities, perhaps using different division/class criteria as requirements from 
DoD 5200.28-STD. Strong motivation exists to resolve the problem with an 
NSA-evaluated product on the EPL. Because this resolution cannot be guaranteed, 
these acquisition documents must deal with a single-system entity (called "the 
product" or "the system"). In this context, little difference exists between the 
terms "computer system" and "automated information system," both used here. 
Section 3.8, "Rationale for Single Entity Approach," presents the rationale for 
this approach. Chapter 5 addresses use of the EPL.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.6   3 13">1.6 REGULATORY HIERARCHY</A></H3>Regulations may be 
written for a major system acquisition, an AlS, a computer system, or only the 
software in a computer system. These entities must be thought of as a nested 
hierarchy. If the scope is a computer system, for example, then AS and major 
system regulations also apply. A similar situation exists in security. 
Regulations deal with information system security (INFOSEC), AlS security, and 
COMPUSEC. These entities are nested when applied to applications. Considering 
the system hierarchy and the security hierarchy, a situation exists that is 
illustrated in Figure 1-2. Thus, requirements for a COMPUSEC acquisition must 
consider, for example, DoD Instruction 5000.2, DoD 5200.1-R, DoD Directive 
5200.28, Figure 1-2 Layers of Regulation DoD-STD-21 67A, and DoD 5200.28-STD.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.7   3 14">1.7 OVERVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE</A></H3>This guideline 
has seven chapters, and three appendices. Each chapter contains pertinent 
references. The text focuses on the chapter's subject, incorporating both 
acquisition and security. Note that Chapter 2 primarily addresses the 
acquisition process, although it is sometimes placed in the context of security. 
Chapters 3 through 6 emphasize security, especially in Chapter 3, which 
addresses security functionality. The two topics finally merge in Chapter 7. 
Table 1-2 identifies chapters and objectives.
<P><B>Table 1-2 Guideline Overview</B>
<P><B>Chapter l General Information - Introduces the guideline.</B>
<P><B>Chapter 2 The Acquisition Process - Provides an overview of the 
acquisition process. Identifies the major elements of financial management. It 
also briefly describes the most important documents to be referenced, produced,

<H3><A name="HDR1.8   3 15">1.8 HOW TO GET HELP</A></H3>This document will not 
answer all the questions or solve all of the problems encountered in an 
acquisition. Other sources follow.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.8.1   4 15">1.8.1 REFERENCE SOURCES</A></H4>Each chapter lists 
the most important references for the chapter's subject matter. Having a 
personal, current copy of many of the references is important. The documents 
will be referred to often. The "must have" list, referenced below in the last 
section of this chapter, is a good place to start.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.8.2   4 15">1.8.2 MAJOR AGENCY OR ORGANIZATION 
COUNTERPARTS</A></H4>Every major agency or organization has several offices that 
can be of assistance:
<P>a. Each organization usually has a security focal point. Some offices 
specialize in most aspects of COMPUSEC. Start with a phone call to the 
Director's office and ask for a directory or a list of offices with names and 
phone numbers.
<P>b. The investigative organization (e.g., security police) sometimes has 
experts in applicable areas.
<P>c. Each organization normally has a contracting staff and a planning and 
budget management staff with expertise in the acquisition process.
<P>d. The user should have a point of contact for the system or project.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.8.3   4 15">1.8.3 SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION 
(SCI)</A></H4>When SCI information is involved, consult the supporting Special 
Security Officer (SSO) or Intelligence Staff Officer (ISO) within the 
organization with whom the responsibility has been delegated.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR1.8.3.1   5 16">1.8.3.1 SCI REQUIREMENTS</A></H5>The SS0 can 
assist with the special clearances, handling, storage, marking, and other 
details required for SCI. The SSO should know how to meet Director of Central 
Intelligence (DCID) 1/16, "Security Policy for Uniform Protection of 
Intelligence Processed in Automated Information Systems and Networks," and 
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIAM) 50-4 "Security of Compartmented Computer 
Operations."
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR1.8.3.2   5 16">1.8.3.2 THREAT SUMMARY</A></H5>The SS0 will be 
able to assist in requesting an "intelligence community" threat summary related 
to an individual project. See Chapter 4, "Threat Risk Management," for more on 
this subject.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.8.4   4 16">1.8.4 OTHER PROGRAM OFFICES</A></H4>Other PMOs or 
SPOs are lucrative information sources. Contact the program offices for 
information on how they have handled similar requirements
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR1.8.5   4 16">1.8.5 NSA</A></H4>If additional help is still 
needed, call or write NSA (at the address shown in the Foreword page of this 
guideline). This organization can usually put you in contact with the right 
person and get you back on track.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR1.9   3 16">1.9 REQUIRED DOCUMENTS</A></H3>Very few PMOs or SPOs 
have a complete suite of reference material. There are, however, a few "must 
have" documents for all program offices. This document listing will help those 
new to acquisition, who are working on computer security in an acquisition 
environment. Appendix A contains a more complete list of historical documents.

<H3><A name="HDR2.1   3 20">2.1 INTRODUCTION</A></H3>DoD acquisitions are worth 
billions of dollars each year. Nearly 98 percent of these acquisitions are small 
contracting efforts worth less than $25,000. That accounts for only 20 percent 
of DoD's procurement dollars. The other two percent of DoD's contract actions 
(those over $25,000) account for 80 percent of the dollars. The large dollar 
contracts bring with them a large number of people and requirements that the 
program manager must deal with efficiently and effectively. This chapter 
provides a brief overview of the acquisition process and the environment one can 
expect to encounter. It provides information on financial management concepts. 
It also introduces the major documents to be prepared during acquisition.

<H4><A name="HDR2.2.1   4 21">2.2.1 PLANNING, PROGRAMMING AND 
BUDGETING</A></H4>PPBS is supported by three operational functions: 1) the 
Action Officer (AO) is the primary advocate of a particular program. He/she 
develops a Program Decision Package (PDP) and presents it to senior management. 
2) The Program Element Monitor (PEM) is the functional staff advocate. The PEM 
guides and monitors PDPs through the PPBS process. When a PDP is approved, the 
PEM monitors and briefs its progress (e.g., quarterly). The AO needs to stay in 
contact with the PEM to ensure the latest information is available. 3) The 
Resource Advisor (RA) is the person in the SPO or PMO who monitors the use of 
resources on a day-to-day basis, helps develop fund targets, and prepares the 
annual budget submission.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.2.2   4 21">2.2.2 REQUIREMENTS GENERATION</A></H4>The mission 
users are present in all acquisitions. They generate mission requirements and 
ultimately receive and use the item or services acquired. The user function may 
be represented by a functional area expert, a major organization (e.g., agency), 
or even a special office. The user sometimes maintains a liaison in the Program 
Office.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.2.3   4 21">2.2.3 ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT</A></H4>This function 
can be further divided into Program Management and Contract Management. 1) The 
program management function could have any of several names - PMO, SPO, or 
Program Office. In a large acquisition, the program management function is a 
separate organization staffed with specialists who are tasked to conduct the 
acquisition. In a small acquisition, it could be one person. 2) A contracting 
function is present in all acquisitions and usually includes a Contracting 
Officer and a Buyer. The contracting function may be located within the program 
management organization or within a special contracting activity. The 
Contracting Officer is the ~ person authorized to obligate the Government (i.e., 
negotiate, modify, and sign contracts). It is important to seek the Contracting 
Officer's advice and assistance early to avoid later problems.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.3   3 21">2.3 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT</A></H3>A structured 
process of identifying financial requirements, obtaining funds, and allocating 
them to competing programs (so top priorities are satisfied) is called the PPBS. 
The PPBS is the official DOD resource management system and is described in DoD 
Instructions 7045-7 and 7045-14. The PPBS is a complex and continuous year-round 
process. It involves people from the President all the way down to individual 
organizations. The PPBS operates in both a top-down and a bottom-up mode. 1) In 
the top-down mode, high level DoD officials prepare policy and strategy 
documents. Those documents consider the threats to the worldwide national 
interests and define the strategy and objectives necessary to counter those 
threats. 2) In the bottom-up mode, a particular organization tracks every penny 
it spends. "Fund cites," noted on every document, involves a financial 
transaction (e.g., travel orders and contracts). The process is complicated, but 
it achieves visibility and accountability for every expense. The information 
collected is required by law to be rolled into successively broader accounting 
Categories and used for tracking appropriations, both for historical purposes 
and for planning future programs.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.4   3 22">2.4 CONTRACTOR/GOVERNMENT INTERFACE</A></H3>All 
acquisitions involve dealing with the information processing industry, known as 
Offerors or Contractors. Their organizations have similarities to Government 
organizations. They will generally have contracting, program management, and 
functional (technical) personnel. However, a business relationship with them is 
not the same as a working relationship with another Government office.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.4.1   4 22">2.4.1 BEFORE CONTRACT AWARD</A></H4>Civilian 
corporations can track potential Government contracts using the following 
sources.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.1.1   5 22">2.4.1.1 MAILING OR BIDDER'S 
LISTS</A></H5>Corporations can get on a mailing list at any Government 
contracting office. The contracting office then sends the corporation 
solicitations for the types of items or Services the corporation provides.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.1.2   5 22">2.4.1.2 COMMERCE BUSINESS DAILY</A></H5>The 
Commerce Department publishes a newspaper called the "Commerce Business Daily" 
(CBD). The CBD is available to civilian organizations by subscription. Every 
open acquisition with an estimated value over $25,000 must be advertised in that 
paper. The CBD also lists potential subcontracting opportunities with major 
defense contractors. The Program Manager normally prepares a synopsis for the 
Contracting Office to submit for publication.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.1.3   5 22">2.4.1.3 SMALL BUSINESSES</A></H5>Smaller 
corporations can participate in large procurements as subcontractors. Local 
contracting offices, the Commerce Business Daily, and the Small Business 
Administration provide leads and contacts that small corporations can pursue.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.4.2   4 23">2.4.2 DURING SOURCE SELECTION</A></H4>During 
source selection, the interface with the Offerors is strictly controlled and 
limited to the Contracting Officer or his/her designee. Some formal 
communications between the Government and the Offeror(s), usually relate to 
clarifying the Offeror's proposal. Often a Government central point of contact 
for technical matters is identified, known as the Contracting Officer's 
Technical Representative (COTR). However, the COTR does not have the authority 
to obligate the Government.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.4.3   4 23">2.4.3 AT CONTRACT AWARD</A></H4>Two important 
meetings are conducted at contract award.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.3.1   5 23">2.4.3.1 POST-AWARD DEBRIEFING</A></H5>Security 
technology is often an eliminator in competition. This session provides feedback 
for industry on how well, in general terms, their responses met the Government's 
requirements. The Program Manager should attend the debriefing and be prepared 
to provide "lessons learned" from the security vantage point. This process will 
help the industry representatives understand where they were responsive and 
where improvements can be made. The purpose is not to recite all the details, 
but to point out security strengths and weaknesses noted in the evaluation of 
Offerors' proposals.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.3.2   5 23">2.4.3.2 AWARD CONFERENCE</A></H5>This meeting is 
the first formal exchange between the Government and the successful Offeror, 
which is now termed the "Contractor." The Program Manager should attend the 
meeting to ensure that security issues are addressed and reflected in the 
minutes.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.4.4   4 23">2.4.4 AFTER CONTRACT AWARD</A></H4>After contract 
award, interface with the Contractor is somewhat easier. Keep the following 
issues in mind.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.4.1   5 23">2.4.4.1 OBLIGATING THE GOVERNMENT</A></H5>No one 
may obligate the Government except a Contracting Officer.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.4.2   5 24">2.4.4.2 CONTRACT SCOPE</A></H5>Specification of 
security is extremely difficult. What has been given to the contractor in an 
RFP, or the response, may later prove to be inadequate. The implications of a 
modification may be great, increasing significantly the effort the contractor 
originally proposed. The result is another negotiation -- bargaining with 
security and dollars as the chips. Diluting security is not an option. Neither 
is overinflated security costs. From the Government's standpoint, two solutions 
apply: adequate specification in the first place or, if that has not happened, 
technically astute trade-offs and cost effective technological innovation. This 
is the most important time to call on security expertise.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.4.3   5 24">2.4.4.3 TECHNICAL INTERCHANGE 
MEETING</A></H5>The safest way to communicate with a Contractor is via a 
Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM). A TIM is formal and requires preparation of 
minutes that document the proceedings. The Contractor usually prepares these 
minutes and the Contracting Officer reviews the minutes to ensure that changes 
in contract scope have not been made.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.4.4   5 24">2.4.4.4 CONTRACT CHANGES</A></H5>The Government 
initiates most contract changes. Exceptions include Contractor- proposed 
engineering changes. Changes may be necessary to clarify, correct, or change 
requirements or schedules. All changes require the same care and review as the 
original RFP.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.4.4.5   5 24">2.4.4.5 INFORMAL CONTACT</A></H5>Telephone 
calls, face-to-face meetings, and general correspondence are frequently used for 
informal discussions of technical and administrative matters. Both parties must 
be careful not to exceed the limits of their authority. If a question arises 
about what may be discussed, consult the Contracting Officer in advance.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR2.5   3 24">2.5 DOCUMENT PREPARATION</A></H3>A large number of 
documents must be prepared for most acquisitions. Most can be scaled up or down 
according to the size, scope, and particular needs of individual programs. 
Appendix B provides an overview of the most important and widely used documents 
for each of the four major areas, respectively: planning and financial 
management, program management, mission user, and contracting. Appendix B 
includes major references to help document preparation. Subsequent paragraphs 
discuss the documents most important to the user of this guideline. These key 
documents are usually required for "most" programs. Smaller programs could 
either combine or reduce the size of individual documents according to the needs 
of the program.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.5.1   4 25">2.5.1 PLANNING AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
DOCUMENTS</A></H4>These documents provide guidance to people in the organization 
responsible for conducting acquisition activities.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.1.1   5 25">2.5.1.1 POLICY AND STRATEGY DOCUMENTS</A></H5>In 
the top-down mode, high-level DoD officials prepare policy and strategy 
documents, which include National Security Decision Directives, Defense 
Guidance, and the long-term (e.g., five year) Defense Program. They consider the 
threats to worldwide national interests, and define the strategy and objectives 
necessary to counter those threats.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.1.2   5 25">2.5.1.2 THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVE MEMORANDUM 
(POM)</A></H5>The POM provides the response, listed in priority order, to the 
DoD planning documents.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.1.3   5 25">2.5.1.3 PROGRAM DECISION MEMORANDUM</A></H5>The 
DoD then adjusts the POM to ensure each organization's plans are consistent with 
DoD guidance. The results are published as the Program Decision Memorandum.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.1.4   5 25">2.5.1.4 BUDGETS</A></H5>Budget estimate 
submission and final publication of the Budget are the next steps in the 
process.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.1.5   5 25">2.5.1.5 APPROPRIATIONS</A></H5>Appropriations 
are legal authority from Congress to spend dollars on specific line items, or 
for specific programs. Appropriations to an organization are the result of the 
budget submission, often followed by a long negotiation process. An 
appropriation category helps define how funds will be spent. Congress enacts 
Public Laws to appropriate funds formally to specify these categories.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.1.6   5 25">2.5.1.6 OBLIGATION AUTHORITIES</A></H5>The DoD 
passes funds via documents called "Obligation Authorities (OAs)." At the lowest 
organizational level, the target dollars an organization has available to spend 
are usually distributed quarterly.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.1.7   5 26">2.5.1.7 PROGRAM DECISION PACKAGE</A></H5>The 
PDP, used in conjunction with budget submissions, explains what is needed, why 
it is needed, and the impact to the functional area operational mission if the 
program does not receive funding. The PDP is the basic input to the PPBS. 
Although the Organization responsible for planning and financial management 
(e.g., Plans) writes the PDP, Program Management input is normally solicited. 
The document should be kept current. The dollar figures in the PDP must be 
supportable and the words must be as compelling as the need.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.5.2   4 26">2.5.2 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT DOCUMENTS</A></H4>These 
documents provide guidance to the people in the organization responsible for 
conducting acquisition activities.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.1   5 26">2.5.2.1 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVE 
(PMD)</A></H5>The PMD is the first document that authorizes a program to begin. 
The Program Manager should get a copy and review it thoroughly to determine the 
program participants and their roles, the basic operational objectives, schedule 
and milestones, and the resources (both people and dollars) approved by the 
acquiring organization. The PMD usually identifies a series of supporting plans 
to be written (e.g., the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP)). If security is 
a major concern, a separate section of the PMD will address this topic.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.2   5 26">2.5.2.2 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PLAN 
(PMP)</A></H5>The PMP is written in response to tasking cited in the PMD. The 
PMP amplifies the roles, responsibilities, tasks, and objectives called out in 
the PMD. The PMP specifically describes the organizations, players, and assigned 
tasks. Like the PMD, the PMP often lists a number of supporting plans, 
identifies who will prepare them, and gives dates for submission (e.g., Human 
Systems Integration Plan, Program Protection Plan, Software Development Plan, 
Systems Engineering Management Plan, Technology Assessment and Control Plan, 
Training and Development Plan, and Risk Management Plans). Security-relevant 
issues are often described in broad terms. Based on this general guidance, the 
Program Manager will prepare security- relevant chapters or annexes for a number 
of support plans.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.3   5 27">2.5.2.3 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN 
(CMP)</A></H5>The CMP provides both high-level and detailed procedures for 
developing the baseline the system and identifying, processing, and controlling 
system changes. Usually, the CMP will identify a Configuration Control Board 
(CCB), which is responsible for the administrative processes, and serves as a 
technical body to evaluate proposed changes. As the security focal point, the 
Program Manager should serve as a member of the CCB to ensure that 
security-relevant issues are adequately addressed. He/she may also be asked to 
evaluate changes to assess their "security impact."
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.4   5 27">2.5.2.4 SOURCE SELECTION PLAN (SSP)</A></H5>The 
SSP describes the Source Selection Organization, its roles, functions, 
responsibilities, and the overall strategy for evaluating proposals (the topic 
of volume 4 of this guideline series). Normally, the 55P calls for several teams 
of people to participate in the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB). 
Typically, these teams will be functionally organized, for example, responsible 
for technical, management, and cost issues. The SSP also outlines award criteria 
and evaluation factors along with a scoring methodology. The Program Manager 
should prepare input for the security-relevant portions of the SSP. The Program 
Manager may also chair the Security Panel of the Technical Team.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.5   5 27">2.5.2.5 PROPOSAL EVALUATION GUIDE 
(PEG)</A></H5>Derived from the SSP, the PEG contains detailed procedures on the 
SSEB's operation. The PEG describes the composition of the evaluation teams, 
their subordinate panels, and their operating rules. The PEG contains the 
specific evaluation standards and factors against which Offeror proposals will 
be judged. The Program Manager should prepare and coordinate the evaluation 
standards for security matters. Typically, these standards would be used 
predominately in the Technical Area. However, several Management Area standards 
must be prepared as well (e.g., an Offeror must describe his/her compliance with 
DoD 5220.22-M, the Industrial Security Manual). Above all, the Program Manager's 
role in providing (or coordinating for) evaluation criteria and standards must 
not be neglected. After contract award, it will be too late to correct 
discrepancies or oversights without the Contractor justifiably seeking "fair and 
equitable" compensation for errors. Furthermore, it must be ensured that an 
Offeror is selected whose proposal best meets the Government's requirements. The 
PEG is the vehicle to ensure that outcome.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.6   5 27">2.5.2.6 ACQUISITION DECISION 
MEMORANDUM</A></H5>This memorandum represents approval of a particular milestone 
phase and authorization for a program to move into the next milestone phase.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.7   5 28">2.5.2.7 ACQUISITION PROGRAM 
BASELINES</A></H5>Baselines embody the cost, schedule, and performance 
objectives for a program and should be approved by the milestone decision 
authority at milestone reviews. Baselines include the Concept Baseline, the 
Development Baseline, and the Production Baseline.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.8   5 28">2.5.2.8 COMPUTER RESOURCES LIFE-CYCLE MANAGEMENT 
PLAN (CRLCMP)</A></H5>Like the PMD, the CRLCMP focuses on managing computer 
resources used in systems throughout their individual life cycles. That is, the 
CRLCMP identifies the resources, responsible supporting organizations, and the 
overall strategy to ensure adequate life-cycle support is available. Also, 
similar to the PMD, the CRLCMP has a subordinate document that provides detailed 
support procedures. This document, called the Computer Resources Integrated 
Support Document (CRISD), describes in detail the organizational tasks and 
procedures for life-cycle support of the computer resource.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.9   5 28">2.5.2.9 TEST AND EVALUATION MASTER PLAN 
(TEMP)</A></H5>As prescribed by the PMD, the TEMP is the principal source of 
information for all testing activities. The TEMP describes the complete suite of 
tests, the test objectives, and cites the organizations that will participate in 
the testing program. Depending on the testing program scope, the TEMP may have a 
separate chapter or annex that describes security testing. The Program Manager 
should beCome familiar with the TEMP and be prepared to provide test plans, test 
data, and test procedures for the security-relevant concerns and issues 
identified in the TEMP.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.2.10   5 28">2.5.2.10 INTEGRATED LOGISTICS SUPPORT PLAN 
(ILSP)</A></H5>The ILSP addresses reliability, maintainability, and 
sustainability for the AIS. The plan also describes the maintenance, supply, 
transportation, training, packaging, and other support capabilities required to 
Operate and maintain the secure AIS. The Program Manager should ensure 
security-relevant issues are addressed in the ILSP (e.g., methods for shipping 
classified devices to a depot for repair).
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR2.5.3   4 28">2.5.3 MISSION USER DOCUMENTS</A></H4>These 
documents describe the required Capabilities, functions, and features of the

<H5><A name="HDR2.5.3.2   5 29">2.5.3.2 JUSTIFICATION FOR MAJOR SYSTEMS NEW 
START</A></H5>This documentation describes a full range of alternatives before 
deciding to initiate a new acquisition. The justification describes operational 
needs, projected threats, and plans to identify and research alternative 
concepts for POM submission. This is supported by the "Federal Information 
Resources Management Regulation," (FIRMR) (Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
201, Chapter 29) requirement to conduct a Requirement Analysis and an Analysis 
of Alternatives.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.3.3   5 29">2.5.3.3 SYSTEM THREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT 
(STAR)</A></H5>A threat assessment is required for all major programs. 
Historically, the STAR has not placed adequate emphasis on COMPUSEC. Identifying 
the threat of malicious logic attacks (e.g., viruses, worms, and Computer 
misuse) is important to the security of the system. The STAR will also be used 
as input to the System Threats and Vulnerabilities Risk Analysis required by DoD 
5200.28-M. The user, or the security expert in the PMO or SPO, should contact 
the intelligence function to initiate the process. See Chapter 4, "Threat Risk 
Management",for more details.

identifies requirements that flow from base level up the chain of command.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.3.6   5 30">2.5.3.6 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION</A></H5>The 
Functional Description is also referred to as the System/Segment or "A" 
Specification. It is the top-level specification that describes in broad terms 
the operational capabilities of the system, or a major component (segment) of 
the system, to be acquired. The document should include macro-level functional, 
performance, and interface requirements that must be satisfied. The "A" 
Specification always answers the "what" question, and, in general, is prepared 
by the mission user, but may also be prepared by a support organization or 
contractor. Once approved, the "A" Specification becomes the functional baseline 
for the secure AIS.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.3.7   5 30">2.5.3.7 SYSTEM/SUBSYSTEM 
SPECIFICATIONS</A></H5>The System/Subsystem Specifications consist of a series 
of documents that divides and describes in more detail the specific functions 
and features first described by the "A" Specification. The "B" Specifications 
begin to further describe the design and development parameters of specific 
subsets of the secure AIS. Different types of these specifications include prime 
item, critical item, and software development specifications.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.3.8   5 30">2.5.3.8 2.5.3.8 SOFTWARE UNIT 
SPECIFICATIONS</A></H5>Software Unit Specifications are also called "C" 
Specifications. A detailed development specification applies to each component 
of the system. The "C" Specifications are the documents that the "builders" of 
the system use to construct the various parts of the system. Different types of 
"C" Specifications can exist, including critical item product specifications and 
software design documents.

<H5><A name="HDR2.5.3.10   5 30">2.5.3.10 INFORMATION FOR BID</A></H5>This type 
of document is normally used for acquisitions of standard commercial 
off-the-shelf (COTS) items, where several vendors could provide the same item or 
capability. If the requirements are satisfied, the low bidder has the highest 
likelihood of winning the contract.

<H5><A name="HDR2.5.3.12   5 31">2.5.3.12 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 
(RFI)</A></H5>This type of document typically precedes an RFP. The RFP is 
actually a draft RFP issued to obtain feedback from industry on the approach, 
content, and language of the proposed solicitation. The objective is to ensure 
the final RFP is clear, comprehensive, and fair to all Competitors. An RFP also 
helps to ensure requirements can be met using available technology, that the 
schedule is realistic, and the approach is workable. It is important for the 
Program Manager to listen to industry's feedback, although he/she does not 
always have to agree.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR2.5.3.13   5 31">2.5.3.13 REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</A></H5>The RFP 
is often referred to as the solicitation package. The RFP is the most widely 
used document for AlS oriented acquisitions and is the focus of this procurement 
guideline series. The General Services Administration (GSA) has available 
standard solicitation documents for Systems, Software, Equipment and 
Maintenance. A guide on how to use these documents is also available. While the 
specifications for security must still be developed, the basic acquisition 
documents have proven to be valuable, especially to those new to acquisition. A 
standard RFP has thirteen sections, which are each referred to by a letter (see 
Table 2-1). Upon contract award, the final RFP, with sections L and M omitted, 
becomes the final contract guideline, including security-relevant aspects, are

section contains a list of all documents, exhibits, attachments, and other forms 
used to build and execute the RFP. This section usually includes a series of 
attachments, each one dedicated to a list of specific items. For example, the 
Glossary of Terms would be one attachment, the CDRL would be another, while the 
list of FIPS PUBS and Federal Standards (FED STDS) would be yet another.
<P>e. Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors. This 
section contains the instructions and conditions of the acquisition. It informs 
Offerors of their actions and responsibilities if they submit a proposal. It 
covers such things as proposal format, oral presentations, and the proposal 
preparation instructions. Proposal preparation instructions can be used to an 
advantage by requiring the Offerors to submit outlines of how they will conduct 
SOW tasking. This process will assist in understanding the Offeror's technical 
approach and allow assessment of their understanding of the technical 
requirements.
<P>f. Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award. This section presents to the 
bidder the basis of award and how proposals will be validated and evaluated. It 
should be taken from the evaluation team evaluation criteria (with respect to 
security in AISs, the topic of volume 4 of this guideline series).

<H3><A name="HDR3.1   3 37">3.1 INTRODUCTION</A></H3>Because of its general 
application and the use of formal methodologies, COMPUSEC has become the most 
rigorous and complex of all the security disciplines. Nevertheless, a systems 
programming expertise is not required to understand the basic concepts. This 
chapter provides most of the information needed to ensure that AlS acquisitions 
satisfy COMPUSEC concerns.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.2   3 37">3.2 COMPUTER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</A></H3>This 
section interprets requirements provided by DoD Directive 5200.28 and DoD 
5200.28-STD.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.2.1   4 37">3.2.1 SECURITY POLICY</A></H4>Security policy 
statements and directives form the basis for requiring security protection 
features in an AS. They are based on Public Laws, Executive Orders, and Federal 
(e.g., DoD) regulatIons. Protecting sensitive data or information from 
compromise, denial of service, and unauthorized alteration are fundamental 
requirements of DoD policy. When dealing with an AlS, the security policy can be 
implemented by some mixture of measures.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.2.1.1   5 37">3.2.1.1 SECURITY PROTECTION OTHER THAN 
COMPUSEC</A></H5>These security protection features are outside the physical or 
logical boundaries of the AlS. They include the physical, personnel, 
administrative (procedural), and operations security disciplines. External 
security protection measures also include the study/control of compromising 
emanations (TEMPEST) and communications security (COMSEC).
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.2.1.2   5 37">3.2.1.2 COMPUSEC PROTECTION</A></H5>COMPUSEC 
protection features are inside the physical or logical boundaries of the AlS, 
and are emphasized in this guideline. The focus of this guideline is on 
computer-enforced measures, or COMPUSEC, but some overlap with the other 
disciplines can occur. Internal security protection measures really mean the 
Trusted Computing Base (TCB). The TCB is the collection of hardware, software, 
and procedures implemented to protect the data or information processed or 
stored by the AIS.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.2.2   4 38">3.2.2 TRUSTED COMPUTING BASE</A></H4>A TCB must be 
evaluated and approved to meet a set of evaluation standards.
<P>DoD 5200.28-STD contains these standards. The four divisions of evaluation 
standards follow: D is minimal protection, C is discretionary protection, B is 
mandatory protection, and A is verified protection. C and B are further divided 
into two and three classes, respectively. Systems evaluated by NSA that meet a 
set of standards receive a TCB division/class rating. These and other systems 
that are evaluated for certification against the division/class ratings are 
presumed to provide a degree of security protection that is "trusted" to meet 
the protection requirements for that division/class.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.2.2.1   5 39">3.2.2.1 THE DIVISIONS/CLASSES</A></H5>Figure 3-1 
portrays the way the requirements for each class build upon preceding 
requirements as the division/class increases. Following Figure 3-1 are Tables 
3-1 through 3-4, which cite brief definitions of each division/class under the 
appropriate division heading. Note that the criteria for each division/class 
include and incorporate the criteria for the preceding class. The tables list 
the division/classes from lowest to highest confidence.

There is little or no evidence of specific security protection features. (No classes exist).<P>
               <P>
</P></PRE>Table 3-2 Division C, Discretionary Protection
<P>Class Cl, Discretionary Security Protection - A primitive TCB provides 
elementary protection to separate users from data. The system is expected to 
operate in an environment of cooperating users processing data at the same 
level.
<P>Class CS, Controlled Access Protection - A basic TCB provides 
intermediate-level protection. C2 features more clearly distinguish user actions 
through log-in procedures, auditing security-relevant events, isolating data, 
providing resource protection and ensuring each user is accountable.
<P>Table 3-3 Division B, Mandator Protection
<P>Class B1, Labeled Security Protection - An intermediate-level TCB provides 
elementary Mandatory Access Control protection, as well as intermediate-level 
Discretionary Access Control. Mandatory Access Control is extended to users and 
data. Data must be labeled and users must be given explicit permission to access 
data. Sensitivity labels are used to make access- control decisions. Such 
decisions are based on an informal security policy model that states the rules 
for how named subjects (e.g.,users) may access named objects (e.g.,files).
<P>Class B2, Structured Protection - An enhanced-level TCB provides 
intermediate-level Mandatory Access Control protection and enhanced-level 
Discretionary Access Control. Sensitivity labels enforce access-control 
decisions. Decisions are based on a formally specified security policy model 
that regulates how every subject (e.g.,users, programs) may access every object 
(e.g.,files, records). Protection features are carefully separated into 
protection-critical and non-protection-critical elements. Class B2 requires 
additional internal protection, such as the prevention of information passing 
through covert channels. Operational support features are provided, including 
Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and Administrator functions. 
Stringent configuration management practices are required.
<P>Class B3, Security Domains - An advanced TCB provides highly effective 
Discretionary and Mandatory Access Controls. B3 controls must implement the 
"reference monitor concept" so that all accesses are shown to satisfy a formally 
specified security policy model. Significant security and software engineering 
must be accomplished during the design, testing, and implementation phases to 
achieve the required level of confidence, or trust. Operational support features 
extend auditing capabilities, as well as ISSO functions needed for a trusted 
system recovery.
<P>Table 3-4 Division A, Verified Protection
<P>Class A1, Verified Design - A highly advanced TCB provides exceptionally 
effective Discretionary and Mandatory Access Controls with identical 
requirements to those of Class B3 TCB systems. Formal analyses prove the design 
and its implementation are rigorous (in the mathematical sense) using a Formal 
Top-Level Specification. Operational support features are further extended, 
providing techniques for trusted system distribution to deployed sites.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.2.2.2   5 41">3.2.2.2 THE REQUIREMENTS</A></H5>Each TCB 
division/class has a set of requirements. Only a general description of the 
protection concept appears below. No attempt is made to distinguish between 
divisions/classes.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1   6 41">3.2.2.2.1 SECURITY POLICY</A></H6>Security 
policy statements govern the manner in which sensitive (classified) information 
is protected.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1.1   6 41">3.2.2.2.1.1 Discretionary Access Control 
(DAC) (all classes): </A></H6>This is the need-to-know concept. DAC enforces 
rules for sharing data among users.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1.2   6 41">3.2.2.2.1.2 Object Reuse (Class C2 and 
above): </A></H6>All storage areas (e.g., main memory or mass storage) 
reallocated by the system must not contain residual data for which the new 
subject is not authorized.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1.3   6 41">3.2.2.2.1.3 Labels (Class B1 and above): 
</A></H6>Within a TCB, labels represent the sensitivity or security level. A 
subject's label represents its clearance level and need-to-know privileges; an 
information object's label indicates the actual sensitivity of the information. 
A storage object's label indicates the sensitivity of the data held or permitted 
to be held.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1.4   6 41">3.2.2.2.1.4 Label Integrity (Class B1 and 
above): </A></H6>Sensitivity labels must correspond exactly to the sensitivity 
level of the subject (person who uses resources) or object (resources used) with 
which they are associated.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1.5   6 41">3.2.2.2.1.5 Exchanging Labeled Information 
(Class 01 and above):</A></H6>Exchanging (e.g., importing or exporting) 
information between the TCB and a Communications channel or the TCB and a device 
requires the TCB to distinguish between multilevel and single-level devices.
<P>a. Multilevel Devices (Class B1 and above): For multilevel devices, the TCB 
ensures that an object's sensitivity is within the range permitted. The TCB 
exchanges both the object and its sensitivity label.
<P>b. Single-Level Devices (Class 01 and above): For a single-level devices, 
only the object needs to be exchanged. Since the sensitivity level is "fixed" 
and known in advance, the TCB only allows exchange at that level.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1.6   6 41">3.2.2.2.1.6 Labeling Human-Readable Output 
(Class B1 and above): </A></H6>Output must be marked with a plain language 
version of the object's sensitivity level (e.g., English language security 
classification banner at the top and bottom of each page).
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1.7   6 42">3.2.2.2.1.7 Mandatory Access Control (Class 
B1 and above): </A></H6>From Mandatory Access Control (MAC) rules, subjects 
(e.g., users, programs) are allowed access (e.g., read, write, change, delete) 
to objects (e.g., data). A subject's clearance level must always be consistent 
with an object's sensitivity level. Thus, subjects may read from an area (e.g., 
main memory) with an equal or lesser sensitivity level, and may write to an area 
with an equal or greater sensitivity level.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1.8   6 42">3.2.2.2.1.8 Subject Sensitivity Labels 
(Class B2 and above): </A></H6>During an interactive session, the TCB must keep 
the terminal user informed of changes in the "current working security level." 
Terminal users may request a display of the complete sensitivity label for 
processes they are using.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.1.9   6 42">3.2.2.2.1.9 Device Labels (Class B2 and 
above): </A></H6>The TCB must keep track of the minimum and maximum security 
level assignments of all physically attached devices (e.g,., terminals, 
printers). These assignments are often called "classmarks".
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.2   6 42">3.2.2.2.2 
ACCOUNTABILITY</A></H6>Accountability is the ability to trace actions affecting 
security to the responsible party. This feature ensures the user's dialogue is 
with the TCB and not with a masquerading program (e.g., during log-in).
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.2.1   6 42">3.2.2.2.2.1 Identification and 
Authentication (all classes): </A></H6>Users must identify themselves (e.g., 
provide user-identifications) to the system and the TCB must authenticate the 
user's identity (e.g., passwords).
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.2.2   6 42">3.2.2.2.2.2 Audit (Class C2 and above): 
</A></H6>The TCB must record all security- relevant events (e.g., changes to 
device classmarks) in a TCB-protected area called the "audit trail."
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.2.3   6 42">3.2.2.2.2.3 Trusted Path (Class B2 and 
above): </A></H6>The TCB must provide a means to identify itself clearly to the 
user.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3   6 42">3.2.2.2.3 ASSURANCE</A></H6>Assurance provides 
the steps necessary to demonstrate that the security policy has been correctly 
implemented.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3.1   6 42">3.2.2.2.3.1 System Architecture (all 
classes): </A></H6>The system architecture must separate TCB processes (e.g., 
reference monitor) from user processes (e.g., application programs). The system 
architecture must also separate each user's data from every other user's data.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3.2   6 43">3.2.2.2.3.2 System Integrity (all classes): 
</A></H6>Periodic validation checks must ensure the correct functioning of the 
TCB protection elements. The checks can either be automated, or they can be 
invoked manually by the system operator.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3.3   6 43">3.2.2.2.3.3 Covert Channel Analysis (Class 
B2 and above): </A></H6>Covert channels are signalling paths that can bypass the 
TCB's access controls and therefore, can allow violation of policy. Covert 
channels must be identified, their bandwidth minimized, and their use audited.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3.4   6 43">3.2.2.2.3.4 Trusted Facility Management 
(Class B2 and above): </A></H6>The separate functions of system operator and 
system administrator must be defined and supported with TCB features. The system 
operator has fewer security-relevant privileges than the system administrator.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3.5   6 43">3.2.2.2.3.5 Security Testing (all classes): 
</A></H6>The range and depth of testing increases for each division/class. Test 
results must affirm the implementation of security protection features as 
intended.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3.6   6 43">3.2.2.2.3.6 Design Specification and 
Verification (Class B1 and above): </A></H6>The security policy enforced by the 
TCB must be informally (i.e., non-mathematically) struCtured or formally (i.e., 
mathematically) modeled. At higher TCB classes, the mathematical modeling 
becomes more rigorous (e.g., the spectrum includes demonstration, providing a 
Convincing argument, and proving). The requirement for correspondence between 
the policy model and the design specifications (e.g., Descriptive Top-Level 
Specification (DTLS) and Formal Top-Level Specification (FTLS)) also increases.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3.7   6 43">3.2.2.2.3.7 Configuration Management (Class 
B2 and above): </A></H6>Configuration management refers to the procedures used 
to establish a baseline and then to control changes throughout the system's life 
cycle. Configuration management becomes more comprehensive as the TCB 
division/class increases.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3.8   6 43">3.2.2.2.3.8 Trusted Recovery (Class B3 and 
above): </A></H6>Procedures must be available to preserve seCurity protection 
integrity and return the system to a secure processing environment after a 
failure.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.3.9   6 43">3.2.2.2.3.9 Trusted Distribution (Class A1): 
</A></H6>This feature ensures the provision of a "high confidence" system for 
distributing each TCB version, also ensuring its integrity upon receipt at each 
site.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.4   6 44">3.2.2.2.4 DOCUMENTATION</A></H6>The documents 
required describe the TCB's objectives, design, performance, and operation. 
Documentation must include a Statement of Work task to develop these documents 
and invoke the Contract Requirements Lists (CDRLs) to specify delivery to the 
Government.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.4.1   6 44">3.2.2.2.4.1 3.2.2.2.4.1 Security Features 
User's Guide (all classes): </A></H6>This guide targets system users and 
developers. The document describes the security protection features of the TCB, 
provides guidelines on their use, and explains how they interact. The guide 
should also describe expected system reaction to security-relevant events, such 
as access violations.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.4.2   6 44">3.2.2.2.4.2 Trusted Facility Manual (all 
classes): </A></H6>This manual applies to the System Administrator, Security 
Officer, users, and operators. Since this document provides detailed information 
about the security protection features provided by the TCB and describes how to 
use them, its distribution should be strictly controlled. The document should 
cover "everything you need to know" to generate and operate the specific TCB in 
an operationally secure environment. This information should include loading, 
generating, and initializing a new TCB; maintaining and examining audit files; 
conducting shutdown, restart, and recovery; as well as running diagnostics, 
managing sensitivity labels, and managing user access authorizations.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.4.3   6 44">3.2.2.2.4.3 Test Documentation (all 
classes): </A></H6>Test documentation provides the test plan(s) and the results 
of testing the TCB security protection features. The range and depth increases 
as the TCB division/class increases. Test results must be controlled if they 
point out vulnerabilities.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.2.2.2.4.4   6 44">3.2.2.2.4.4 Design Documentation (all 
classes): </A></H6>A full complement of design documentation is required. The 
scope depends on the TCB division/class. The scope ranges from a simple 
statement of the protection objectives through a mathematically based 
description, to the detailed proofs and correspondence of the specifications, 
and back to the security policy model and its objectives.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.3   3 44">3.3 SOFTWARE</A></H3>Since most computer security 
protection features are implemented in software, a clear majority of the Program 
Manager's time is spent dealing with software issues. Time should be taken to 
review DoD 5200.28-STD as well as the other references given at the end of this 
chapter. This review will help the Program Manager prepare for the acquisition 
concerns about software.

section identifies software factors important in a trusted application.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.1.1   5 45">3.3.1.1 STRUCTURE AND 
DISCIPLINE</A></H5>Software matters require structure and discipline. Structure 
provides procedures, techniques, and check-points used to measure progress. 
Detailed planning, step-by-step execution of the plans, and an iterative 
approach are important. Discipline provides a way to remain on the charted 
course without being trapped by pitfalls. One must do more than blindly "follow 
the rules." Good documentation configuration management, and strict adherence to 
details are important discipline factors.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.1.2   5 45">3.3.1.2 COST ESTIMATING</A></H5>Estimating the 
cost of software development is difficult, at best. Cost overruns invariably 
lead to increased software risk, a serious concern for secure systems. Tools are 
available that contractors and other software developers use for cost 
estimation. Nevertheless, a great deal of subjective input influences to the 
"final" estimate. The skill level of the people involved, the complexity of the 
system, and many other factors all play a role. The contractor must describe the 
process, ground rules, and assumptions used to estimate software development 
costs. The Program Manager should "walk through" the steps to be certain the 
process makes sense. If the contractor's documentation cannot be fully 
understood, he/she should be asked for an informal briefing or chalk-board 
session. This process may avoid major cost and schedule changes later.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.1.3   5 45">3.3.1.3 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</A></H5>An 
appropriate modern, high-order programming language should be required to 
improve security. For example modern languages that strictly enforce "strong 
typing" should be used. Strong typing is the assignment of legal access (e.g., 
read, write, modify) to objects. Moreover, languages often require programmers 
to restrict their data definitions to pre-designated storage areas (e.g., 
certain main memory blocks). Ada is the DoD required language, and alternate 
languages must be preapproved. Software engineering disciplines (structured 
programming with structured "walkthroughs") make it more difficult for an 
attacker to hide covert code or logic bombs. If the use of assembly language for 
applications is allowed, the source must be checked carefully for illegal 
Operations (e.g., the use of undocumented operations codes). Such use would 
require a special section in the test plans and configuration management plan.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.1.4   5 45">3.3.1.4 DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 
(DBMSs)</A></H5>Systems that use DBMSs can introduce an additional element of 
risk not present in non-DBMSs. NCSC-TG-021, "Trusted Database Management System 
Interpretation of Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria," provides 
criteria for dealing with this important issue.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.1.5   5 46">3.3.1.5 UTILITIES</A></H5>System utilities 
provide powerful tools for augmenting or developing operating system 
capabilities. Their use must be limited and controlled by the TCB software. The 
security implications for compilers that "automatically optimize" the generated 
object code must be understood. That is, the generated object code will likely 
not be in the identical sequence Corresponding to the source language, although 
the function performed will be correctly done. Linkers (sometimes called 
"Linkage Editors") can also be a security concern, since access to unintended 
data areas can Occur through "external reference" directives. Finally, some 
languages incorporate what is known as "run-time packages," chiefly to perform 
input-output operations. Run-time packages must be included within the 
security-relevant boundary, especially at the higher TCB divisions/classes.

the software development process in terms of documentation required. Different 
terms are used for some of the design documents, but the document requirements 
are similar, if not identical. For example, the terms Functional Description, 
"A" Specification, and System Specification, are usually used interchangeably. 
Note that the process is iterative, and flows from very general top-level policy 
and capabilities requirements statements, down to very precise implementation 
details.

<H4><A name="HDR3.3.3   4 46">3.3.3 MANAGING SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</A></H4>As 
noted above, the key to success with software is structure and discipline. Some 
of the specific success factors follow:
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.3.1   5 47">3.3.3.1 DESIGN 
DOCUMENTATION</A></H5>Documentation must start from the initial statement of 
requirements and continue through to the details of implementing, operating, and 
maintaining the system. The root is in the initial statement of requirements.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.3.3.1.1   6 47">3.3.3.1.1 SECURITY POLICY</A></H6>An explicit 
statement of the security policy should be enforced by the AS. The policy should 
be documented in the specification (requirements) section of the RFP, and should 
clearly state the security enforcement rules by which the system will operate.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.3.3.1.2   6 47">3.3.3.1.2 MODEL</A></H6>Each TCB 
division/class requires a vendor or manufacturer (i.e., contractor) to provide a 
description of the security protection philosophy and how that philosophy is 
translated into the TCB. TCB Class B1 requires development of an informal or 
formal description of the security policy to be enforced by the TCB. TCB Class 
B2 and above require formal models of the security policy. As might be expected, 
these models (both informal and formal) require special expertise to develop and 
evaluate, since they will be written in special mathematical notation (e.g., 
algebraic specification or set theory). It should be ensured that the expertise 
needed to review and evaluate the contractor's submissions is available, either 
internally or from the NSA.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.3.3.1.3   6 47">3.3.3.1.3 DESCRIPTIVE TOP-LEVEL 
SPECIFICATION</A></H6>The DTLS is equivalent to a Security Features Functional 
Description. This
<P>specification describes the security protection capabilities required by the 
AIS, and is required for TCB Classes B2, B3, and A1. Although written in English 
prose, this document will contain a good deal of technical language. The DTLS 
should address both hardware and software capabilities.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.3.3.1.4   6 47">3.3.3.1.4 FORMAL TOP-LEVEL 
SPECIFICATION</A></H6>This document is required for TCB Class A1 only. It is 
written in a formal mathematical language to ensure that the design is 
consistent with the model of the security policy being enforced. The FTLS also 
addresses both hardware and software protection. This specification is 
accompanied by a separate formal verification of the specification. This 
verification proves that the design corresponds completely and accurately to the 
formal security policy model. Special expertise is also required to review and 
evaluate this document.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.3.3.1.5   6 48">3.3.3.1.5 SYSTEM/SUBSYSTEM SPECIFICATION ("B" 
SPECIFICATION) AND UNIT SPECIFICATION ("C" SPECIFICATION)</A></H6>The design 
documentation, from this level down, begins to describe, in ever-increasing 
detail, the "how-to" of the TCB build process. At this level of detail, care 
must be taken when reviewing the contractor's design approach. Concern should 
focus on thoroughness and completeness, not "how to." If the required 
capabilities, functions, and features are present, the contractor should have 
some freedom of choice. The contractor must also comply with the 
contract-specified standards and specifications. If a question arises as to what 
the document is saying, the program manager should ask for an informal briefing 
or chalk-board session.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.3.2   5 48">3.3.3.2 PROGRAMMING</A></H5>Programming, or 
writing computer programs, is the "build" of the development process. The 
contractor should not begin to program until after approval of the 
specifications. This restriction will avoid restarts and changes as the 
acquisition progresses.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.3.3   5 48">3.3.3.3 TESTING</A></H5>Both the contractor and 
the Government are heavily involved in testing. The attitude should be "Show me, 
please" throughout the test effort. For the internal TCB-provided security 
protection features, DoD 5200.28-STD requirements should be reviewed for testing 
each division/class. A team of experts should be assembled to help test. Also, 
Chapter 5 of this document, "Security Test and Evaluation," should be reviewed.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.3.4   5 48">3.3.3.4 CONFIGURATION 
MANAGEMENT</A></H5>Configuration Management (CM) for TCB software is only 
required for TCB Classes B2 and above. However, CM should be required for all 
acquisitions, whenever possible. CM is the only way to achieve a structured and 
disciplined approach to software management, regardless of the TCB 
division/class. The situation is likely that some CM will be required in every 
program. The requirement extends to the TCB software by including a Statement of 
Work task. The Program Manager should also participate in the Configuration 
Control Board (CCB), which is the committee that reviews all changes to 
established baselines. Note that the documented procedures for control of 
changes do not need to be as extensive for the lower TCB division/classes (C1 
through B1). Configuration control must extend to distribution, delivery, 
installation, Operation, and maintenance.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.3.5   5 49">3.3.3.5 AUDIT</A></H5>Auditing of 
security-relevant events is required for all TCB division/classes (C2 and 
above). The early identification of audit requirements and strategy is necessary 
to ensure that the accountability requirements are satisfied for the TCB 
division/class, and to ensure they are included in the TCB design. The NSA 
publication NCSC-TG-001,"A Guide To Understanding Audit In Trusted Systems," 
describes the specific audit requirements for each TCB division/class, including 
the events that must be audited and the specific information that must be 
recorded.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.3.6   5 49">3.3.3.6 PASSWORD GENERATION AND 
MANAGEMENT</A></H5>One of the major requirements of all TCB division/classes is 
accountability. The CSC-STD-002-85, "DoD Password Management Guideline," and 
NCSC-TG-017, "A Guide to Understanding Identification and Authentication," 
provide sound practices that will help satisfy the accountability requirement. 
Ensure accountability is included in all AIS RFP requirements. Also ensure the 
information provided in the Trusted Facility Manual and Security Features User's 
Guide is consistent with the principles in this guideline.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.3.3.7   5 49">3.3.3.7 TCB IMPLEMENTATION 
CORRESPONDENCE</A></H5>The process of assuring that the TCB is "properly done" 
is called "correspondence." The technique used is to map the TCB design back to 
the security policy model at the B1 and above levels. In addition, the TCB Class 
A1 requirement calls for mapping the TCB design down to the TCB source code.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.3.4   4 49">3.3.4 CLASSIFIED SOFTWARE</A></H4>If any of the 
software being developed is classified, be sure to check Block 11c, Receipt and 
Generation of Classified Documents and Other Material, of the DD Form 254, 
Contract Security Classification Specification. Trusted software must be 
protected at the highest level of information to be processed.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.3.5   4 49">3.3.5 ACQUISITION TASKS</A></H4>To ensure a 
structured and disciplined approach to software concerns, provide Statement of 
Work tasks appropriate for the TCB division/class being developed. 
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.4   3 49">3.4 HARDWARE</A></H3>Several features of a TCB have 
an impact on hardware or require hardware for support.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.4.1   4 49">3.4.1 PRINCIPAL HARDWARE FACTORS</A></H4>This 
section identifies factors associated with hardware that are important in a 
trusted appliCation.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.4.1.1   5 50">3.4.1.1 INITIAL PROGRAM LOAD 
(IPL)</A></H5>Sometimes referred to as "boot" or "bootstrap," the IPL function 
is always hardware based. The IPL feature loads and begins executing the first 
few instructions necessary to start the system. The chief security concern is 
the initial secure state for TCB Classes B2, B3, and A1. Without assurance the 
system achieves the initial secure state, the TCB cannot be considered secure.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.4.1.2   5 50">3.4.1.2 PROCESSOR STATES</A></H5>To be suitable 
for a TCB, a computer must have at least two distinct processor states 
(sometimes referred to as "operating modes"). The most privileged state should 
be reserved exclusively for the TCB's use and should include special 
instructions or features needed to enforce access control rules or perform 
input/output functions. Another, less privileged state should be used by the 
application programs and must not include those powerful security-related 
capabilities reserved for the TCB. The idea is to isolate privileged 
capabilities and restrict the use of certain instructions (e.g., those which do 
input/output or enforce access control rules) to the TCB alone, while permitting 
the applications programs to perform their mission-oriented functions at a less 
privileged level.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.4.1.3   5 50">3.4.1.3 PROTECTION DOMAIN 
GRANULARITY</A></H5>Small domains (e.g., a few bytes) are ideal for providing 
precise control (down to the byte or word level) but they require a significant 
amount of computer overhead to maintain. The trade-off usually made is to have 
larger protection domains (e.g., 1024 byte blocks) to reduce hardware complexity 
and retain acceptable performance.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.4.1.4   5 50">3.4.1.4 SENSITIVITY LABEL MAPPING TO PROTECTION 
DOMAIN</A></H5><B>MECHANISMS</B>
<P>Hardware features (usually called "keys") allow the TCB to associate specific 
hardware "registers" with the main memory areas (domains) they are protecting. 
There should be sufficient types and numbers of "registers" to ensure the number 
of sensitivity labels for information in the system can be adequately mapped. 
Common ways to achieve these capabilities are through "Descriptor Base 
Registers," "Bounds Registers," and "Virtual Memory Mapping Registers," although 
other approaches may also be used.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.4.1.5   5 50">3.4.1.5 INTEGRITY CHECKING 
MECHANISMS</A></H5>Integrity checking mechanisms usually provide support for 
security functions. For example, memory parity checks and cyclic redundancy 
check schemes ensure errors are detected. Another commonly used technique is 
called a watchdog timer. This timer performs a direct security-related function 
by ensuring an application program cannot "steal all the processor's time" by 
independently checking allocations of processor time.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.4.1.6   5 51">3.4.1.6 DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS (DMA) 
PROTECTION</A></H5>DMA allows input-output to occur simultaneously with the 
processor's normal computational activities. That is, once the processor 
initiates an input-output operation, a separate hardware feature directs the 
flow of data into (or out of) main memory independent of the processor, while 
the processor itself is free to complete other tasks. Since DMA is independent 
of processor intervention, it cannot be confined by the TCB's enforcement 
techniques. Thus, unless DMA security protection is provided, Mandatory Access 
Controls cannot be enforced during DMA operations.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.4.1.7   5 51">3.4.1.7 ASYNCHRONOUS EVENT 
MECHANISMS</A></H5>Asynchronous events are not predictable (e.g., arrival of a 
message, the printer's running out of paper, or communications link errors). 
Asynchronous event mechanisms are hardware features which handle the 
unpredictable, usually by "interrupting" the processor. Once interrupted, the 
processor then deals with the event. For security, the hardware features should 
cause the processor to recognize and respond to specific asynchronous events, 
such as "security policy violations" (in DoD 5200.28-STD phrasing, violations of 
the Simple Security Property or Star Property). Unless hardware features support 
these properties, software must interpret the results of every operation, 
-causIng a severe performance penalty. The penalty may come into conflict with 
mission performance requirements.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.4.2   4 51">3.4.2 CAVEATS</A></H4>Care must be taken not to 
restrict potentially valid solutions in the specifications (requirements), 
statement of work, or CDRL sections of the RFP. Many possible design solutions 
could meet the requirements. Use of specific terms could unintentionally 
preclude the application of alternative techniques. Thus, terms should be used 
that illustrate the concepts involved without restricting the design choices 
available to the contractor. The second guideline of this four-guideline series, 
"Language for RFP Specifications and Statements of Work - An Aid to Procurement 
Initiators," was written specifically to deal with this problem.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.4.3   4 51">3.4.3 MANAGING HARDWARE</A></H4>Dealing 
effectively with security-relevant hardware issues follows the same general 
process as for software. Some specific points to consider include the following:
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.4.3.1   5 51">3.4.3.1 IDENTIFY SECURITY PROTECTION 
FUNCTIONS</A></H5>The Program Manager (or the contractor) should trace the 
allocation of system functions, that are hardware based, from requirements to 
specific devices in the "as-built" drawings. In this way, the hundreds of design 
choices made should not neglect hardware issues, especially where specific 
hardware support is needed for the Trusted Computing Base.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.4.3.1.1   6 52">3.4.3.1.1 SECURITY PROTECTION 
CAPABILITIES</A></H6>Security protection capabilities are identified in the 
top-level specifications. Security protection features allocated to hardware may 
be found in the hardware section of the Functional Description or Descriptive 
Top-Level Specification. 
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.4.3.1.2   6 52">3.4.3.1.2 HARDWARE 
INFORMATION</A></H6>Hardware information will exist in most of the "B" and "C" 
Specification software design documents. This information should allow tracing 
hardware security protection features to successively lower levels of detail.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR3.4.3.1.3   6 52">3.4.3.1.3 SPECIFIC DETAILS ON THE HARDWARE 
FEATURES</A></H6>Details in Section 3.4.1.6 (e.g., DMA protection) can be found 
in the engineering data deliverables. Ensure the Contractor provides the 
technical data and drawings needed to assess the hardware.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.4.3.2   5 52">3.4.3.2 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT, MAINTENANCE, 
AND</A></H5><B>LIFE-CYCLE SUPPORT</B>
<P>These functional areas should follow the same general approaches taken for 
other security-related functions.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.5   3 52">3.5 NETWORKS</A></H3>Network security may be a major 
issue, but many aspects are beyond the scope of this guideline. Guidance for 
network security may be found in NCSC-TG-005, "Trusted Network Interpretation of 
the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria." If significant networking 
requirements exist, issues should be addressed early. Be prepared to face 
difficult problems early in the program.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.6   3 52">3.6 COVERT CHANNELS</A></H3>A covert channel 
provides a means of Communicating information in a way that violates the 
security policy. The two types of covert channels are storage and timing. A 
storage channel occurs when a "sending" process stores an item of data and a 
"receiving" process detects and interprets the information covertly. A timing 
channel occurs when a "sending" process affects a time-dependent system 
parameter, and a "receiving" process observes and interprets this effect as a 
bit of information.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.6.1   4 52">3.6.1 DETECTION</A></H4>Covert channels are easy 
to hypothesize, but difficult to detect, and often they cannot be totally 
eliminated. The next-best approach is to try to identify them, reduce their 
effectiveness, and provide a measure of control over them. Execution flow 
analysis can sometimes detect storage channels, but no formal methods can detect 
timing channels at this time.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.6.2   4 53">3.6.2 RATES</A></H4>High covert channel transfer 
rates (over 100 bits/sec) are a major concern and are generally unacceptable. 
Low transfer rates (under 1 bit/sec) are of less concern because it would take 
too long to Communicate significant amounts of information. (It cannot be 
forgotten, however, there are situations in which a single number or name can be 
highly classified.) Intermediate transfer rates introduce the need for the ISSO 
to monitor covert channel activity. This procedure is done by auditing all known 
events that may be used to exploit the covert channel. The Trusted Facility 
Manual should contain information on what events are audited and how they should 
be interpreted.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.6.3   4 53">3.6.3 COVERT CHANNEL ANALYSIS</A></H4>A covert 
channel analysis is required for Classes B2, B3, and A1. In acquisitions 
requiring these classes, a Statement of Work task should be included in the RFP 
that requires the contractor to conduct a covert channel analysis and the CDRL 
that lists the development of a Covert Channel Analysis. This process will 
require the contractor to deliver a technical report to the Government that 
documents the results of the analysis. An assessment of the report will reveal 
whether covert channels are sufficient to cause redesign or can be tolerated by 
using auditing techniques. 
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.7   3 53">3.7 MAGNETIC REMANENCE</A></H3>The retentive 
properties of magnetic storage media and the known risks in erasing and 
releasing such media should be considered in all AIS acquisitions. The correct 
procedures for clearing and declassifying AS magnetic media must be included in 
the design and implementation documentation of ASs. Contractor and Government 
personnel must both use NSA-approved standards for degaussing and overwriting. 
Degaussing equipment must be evaluated and approved to meet the standards. 
Auditing, record-keeping, testing and control of overwrite software, and the 
handling of equipment malfunctions are risk areas that are often neglected.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.7.1   4 53">3.7.1 GUIDELINES</A></H4>NCSC-TG-025, "A Guide to 
Understanding Data Remanence in Automated Information Systems," should be 
included in all RFP requirements. Another excellent source document is Defense 
Intelligence Agency Manual 50-4, "Security of Compartmented Computer 
Operations(U)," CONFIDENTIAL.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.7.2   4 53">3.7.2 REQUIREMENTS</A></H4>Whenever possible, the 
hardware specifications should require that solid-state data storage components 
be volatile (i.e., total clearing of data with power off). Exceptions (e.g., 
plated wire memory used for extremely high reliability applications) require 
other protection approaches.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.7.3   4 54">3.7.3 MAINTENANCE</A></H4>The maintenance concept 
for the AS must address the magnetic media remanence issue. In particular, the 
Trusted Facility Manual should include procedures for clearing and sanitizing 
magnetic storage media. Dial-in diagnostics, warranty repairs requiring shipment 
of the component back to the contractor, and disposition of replaced components 
are areas for special consideration. In addition, if non-volatile devices are 
used, they must be clearly identified (and labeled if possible).
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.7.4   4 54">3.7.4 DECLASSIFICATION AND 
DESTRUCTION</A></H4>Procedures should be available that address clearing and 
declassifying AIS equipment and media. Clearing is a procedure that removes the 
classified information recorded on the media, but cannot totally declassify the 
media. Declassification is a procedure that totally removes all classified 
information recorded on magnetic media. The declassification method should be 
used when equipment or magnetic media are to be removed from the AIS or a 
controlled environment.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR3.8   3 54">3.8 RATIONALE FOR SINGLE-ENTITY 
APPROACH</A></H3>This section provides rationale for limiting the scope of this 
document to single-entity systems, as was reflected in Paragraph 1.5.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.8.1   4 54">3.8.1 INTERPRETING THE ORANGE BOOK</A></H4>The 
second page of the TCSEC states: "This document is used to provide a basis for 
specifying security requirements in acquisition specifications." This does not 
mean one can combine one Class C2 requirement with four Class B3 requirements. 
Implicit to the statement is the division/class structure. For a defined entity 
of a system to be guaranteed secure in the Orange Book sense means that, at a 
minimum, all of the requirements of some identified division/class must be met. 
To Call that entity a Class B2 entity, however, would require evaluation by NSA 
as a product satisfying the Class B2 criteria. A successful certification 
evaluation of an entity can only state that evaluation and approval have been 
completed as part of a Certification process against, at a minimum, the Class B2 
set of requirements. Nevertheless, that does not make the resulting system Class 
"B2." 
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.8.2   4 54">3.8.2 PROCUREMENT CONSTRAINTS</A></H4>In a 
procurement, the RFP cannot dictate that an item must appear in the EPL because 
of the limited number of items on the EPL, and because the process for placement 
on the EPL is itself a restricted, government controlled process. To state such 
a requirement in the RFP would constitute a discrimination against other vendors 
desiring to bid. It also can not be stated that "a B2 system is required" 
because that implies a product must be taken from the EPL. Therefore, the 
specific TCSEC requirements necessary to meet a Certain division/class rating 
must be identified, without stating that the B2 product is desired. The desire 
for the decreased risk normally inherent in an EPL product, however, can and 
should be reflected as a strong evaluation weighting factor for source 
selection. 
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.8.3   4 55">3.8.3 MULTIPLE-ENTITY SYSTEMS</A></H4>A system may 
be composed of two or more entities, each of which uses different division/class 
security requirements. Some examples of the rationale for doing this are 
provided in NCSC-TG-021,"Trusted Database Management Interpretation" and also in 
Appendix A of NCSC-TG-00s, "Trusted Network Interpretation." The reason could 
also be that, as a system evolves, a higher level of security may be mandated 
for a new part (entity) of the system (called "Y") than was mandated for the 
existing entity (called "X"). Rebuilding the entire system is often not 
practical. The alternative is to consider X and Y as distinct connected 
entities. 
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.8.3.1   5 55">3.8.3.1 ENTITY PROTECTION</A></H5>Distinct 
connected entities X and Y must be isolated from one another in a security 
sense. They each must meet their distinct security requirements. Communications 
by each to the other must be shown to meet an interface policy given for each. 
The interface policy must reflect the outgoing/incoming security policies, 
mutual trust, cascading effect, and least privilege considerations. If 
additional security requirements above those from the TCSEC have been imposed 
(e.g., a two-person rule), these requirements must be considered in the 
interface policy.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR3.8.3.2   5 55">3.8.3.2 ENTITIES WITH THE SAME 
DIVISION/CLASS</A></H5>Even two connected B3 systems may have to be treated as 
distinct entities. One B3 system may have resulted from an uncleared minimum 
user clearance with maximum Secret data sensitivity and the other B3 system may 
have resulted from a Confidential minimum user clearance and maximum Top Secret 
data sensitivity (see Enclosure 4 of DoD Directive 5200.28). Cascading risk 
would probably require the combined system to be evaluated using Class At 
criteria.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.8.4   4 55">3.8.4 RECOMMENDATIONS</A></H4>As stated before, 
this set of four acquisition documents does not deal with this complicated 
situation of acquiring multiple security entity systems because DoD policy has 
not been finalized. This document series only deals with single system-entities. 
Successfully evaluated products will be said to "possess" a division/class 
(e.g., Class B3). System entities will be said to require some minimum 
division/class level (e.g., Class B3) requirements. System entities having 
successfully passed certification evaluation against a minimum division/class 
set of requirements will be identified, but those entities cannot be called, for 
example, Class B3 entities or systems. Instead, use "B3" for Class B3-evaluated 
products and "systems (or system entities) certified against Class B3 
requirements" for the cases treated in this document set. 
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR3.8.5   4 55">3.8.5 WHAT TO DO IN THE MEANTIME</A></H4>As soon 
as composition and interface policy mature to a viable status, this document set

<H2><A name="HDR4   2 58">4 THREAT RISK MANAGEMENT - ANALYSIS, DESIGN, AND 
IMPLEMENTATION</A></H2>
<H3><A name="HDR4.1   3 58">4.1 INTRODUCTION</A></H3>DoD Directive 5000.1 states 
"risk areas . . . to be assessed shall include threat, technology, design and 
engineering, support, manufacturing, cost, schedule, and concurrency." Program 
management must deal with each risk. However, when a computer security person is 
asked about risk, the primary concern is the threat risk of someone 
inadvertently or purposely obtaining, altering, or destroying classified or 
sensitive information in an unauthorized manner. Threat risk is sometimes called 
"security risk." That is the risk addressed in this chapter.
<P>Risk management is the total process used to identify threat risks and 
eliminate or reduce them to acceptable levels. The components of threat risk 
management are risk analysis, cost benefit analysis, safeguard selection, 
security test and evaluation, safeguard implementation, and Systems review. This 
chapter covers risk management during analysis design and implementation. 
Chapter 5 deals with security test and evaluation. Chapter 6 describes the 
activities involved in obtaining certification and accreditation.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.2   3 59">4.2 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</A></H3>Although people 
usually do not consider requirement definition as a security risk management 
function, security risk management is very much involved in the requirement 
definition process. Part of the risk management function, under the auspices of 
the Designated Approving Authority (DAA), is to determine how the regulatory 
requirements, embodied in DoD 5200 series of documents, are satisfied in this 
particular application. The approach to satisfying these requirements (such as 
the assignment of maximum data security and minimum clearance levels) helps to 
dictate the operational security (OPSEC) requirements. Those requirements are 
determined through analysis of cost, risk, and mission considerations.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.2.1   4 59">4.2.1 DOCUMENTING SECURITY 
REQUIREMENTS</A></H4>DoD Directive 5200.28 requires "a more accurate 
specification of overall DoD security requirements." The security aspects of the 
plans required under DoD Instruction 5000.2 (Part 11E) should be combined into a 
single document, the Systems Security Plan. A portion of the concept baseline 
documentation called for in the Concept Exploration and Definition Phase (Parts 
3 and 4B) should be described in the System Security Concept of Operations. This 
process is consistent with the concept of isolating the security process to help 
achieve a higher level of assurance.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.2.2   4 59">4.2.2 SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN</A></H4>The SSP 
describes the system security engineering program. This document describes 
methods to identify security requirements, evaluate and synthesize proposed 
solutions, and coordinate security considerations and requirements with the 
other functional areas in the system development process. The SSP also describes 
the organizational structure, staffing, and other resources that will be 
allocated to satisfy security requirements. The SSP is a living document and 
must be updated as change occurs.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.2.3   4 59">4.2.3 SECURITY POLICY</A></H4>Security policy 
statements are always the basis for requiring security protection features in an 
AIS. The two basic sources of security policy are regulatory and operational.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR4.2.3.1   5 59">4.2.3.1 REGULATORY</A></H5>Regulatory seCurity 
policies are based on Public Laws, Executive Orders, and the many Federal and 
DoD regulations. The protection of sensitive data from compromise, denial of 
service, or unauthorized alteration is the fundamental requirement of national 
security policy.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR4.2.3.2   5 60">4.2.3.2 OPERATIONAL</A></H5>Operational policy 
specifies the operational approach taken to satisfy the regulatory policy as 
well as any additional operational security requirements. High- level 
operational policy involves decisions across all aspects of protection, 
including software and hardware functions, administrative procedures, personnel 
clearances and physical security measures. Risk assessment achieves the next 
level of requirements, which include operational classifications and clearances, 
security mode, and the COMPUSEC division/class requirements. Other 
mission-specific security requirements, or operational constraints that impact 
security, must be specified as policy. Operational policy may further evolve 
based on risk analysis, cost/benefit analysis, and even safeguard design 
decisions.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.2.4   4 60">4.2.4 SYSTEM SECURITY CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS 
(SSCONOPS)</A></H4>The SSCONOPS is an architectural-level document that defines 
the strategy for meeting both operational and regulatory policy requirements. A 
secondary intent is to develop a comprehensive document that provides 
architectural-level direction for the total system security approach. Thus, the 
SSCONOPS serves as the model for security planning and execution for other parts 
of the program.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.2.5   4 60">4.2.5 ACQUISITION SYSTEM PROTECTION PROGRAM 
(ASPP)</A></H4>The ASPP is under development by the Office of the Director of 
Defense Research and Engineering. It will provide an orchestrated DoD program to 
identify critical technologies and to provide techniques, procedures, and 
personnel necessary to deny foreign collection efforts involving those 
technologies.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.3   3 60">4.3 RISK ASSESSMENT</A></H3>Risk assessment is a 
procedure to determine the minimum evaluation division/class requirement for an 
AIS based on the sensitivity of the information present and the clearances of 
its users. Risk assessment is usually performed during the concept development 
phase, prior to system design. This process determines the security mode to be 
employed and an evaluation division/class.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.3.1   4 60">4.3.1 RISK INDEX</A></H4>Risk Index represents the 
disparity between the minimum clearance or authorization of AlS users and the 
maximum sensitivity (e.g., classification and categories) of data handled by the 
AlS. The Risk Index "computes" the approximate degree of security protection 
features required for an AlS application. DoD Directive 5200.28, Enclosure 4, 
provides instructions for the computation, as follows:
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR4.3.1.1   5 60">4.3.1.1 DATA SENSITIVITY</A></H5>The sensitivity 
of data can range from "Unclassified" through "Top Secret with two or more 
categories." Each level of data sensitivity is assigned a number rating ranging 
from zero to seven.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR4.3.1.2   5 61">4.3.1.2 USER CLEARANCE</A></H5>The people who 
will use a system can have security clearances ranging from "Uncleared" to "Top 
Secret with Multiple Categories". Each level of security clearance is also 
assigned a number rating ranging from zero to seven.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR4.3.1.3   5 61">4.3.1.3 REQUIRED TRUSTED COMPUTING 
BASE</A></H5>The required TCB is determined by subtracting the user clearance 
rating from the data sensitivity rating. The result is the Risk Index (a number 
ranging from zero to seven). The Risk Index is then found in a table that 
prescribes the corresponding minimum-required TCB division/class and security 
mode combination. The security mode and minimum security division/class 
requirements are given in Table 4-1. As one moves down the table, increasing 
reliance is placed on the TCB Operating system to provide security protection 
features. Also, the cost of the TCB goes up and operational flexibility 
increases, in terms of who can use the system.

<H4><A name="HDR4.3.2   4 61">4.3.2 SECURITY MODE OF OPERATION</A></H4>A 
security mode of operation describes the environment under which sensitive 
information is processed. DoD Directive 5200.28 defines four security modes of 
operation. Some agencies and applications define modes to a finer granularity. 
Nevertheless, all must satisfy these basic requirements.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR4.3.2.1   5 62">4.3.2.1 DEDICATED SECURITY MODE</A></H5>Each 
user has the clearance, authorization, and need-to-know for all data handled by 
the AlS. If the AIS processes special access information, all users require 
formal access approval. An AS may handle a single classification level and/or 
Category of information or a range of levels and categories. In the latter, 
there is heavy reliance on externally provided security protection features, 
such as security downgrade guards, if any stored information is to be treated at 
a level lower than the processing.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR4.3.2.2   5 62">4.3.2.2 SYSTEM HIGH SECURITY MODE</A></H5>All 
users having access to the AIS possess a security clearance or authorization, 
but not necessarily a need-to-know, for all data handled by the AIS. If the AIS 
processes special access information, all users must have formal access 
approval. Again, there is heavy reliance on externally provided security 
protection features, such as security downgrade guards, if any stored 
information is to be treated at a level lower than the processing.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR4.3.2.3   5 62">4.3.2.3 PARTITIONED SECURITY MODE</A></H5>All 
personnel have the clearance, but not necessarily formal access approval and 
need-to-know, for all information handled by the AlS. This security mode 
encompasses the compartmented mode defined in DClD 1/16. There is a heavy 
reliance on both internally and externally provided security protection 
features.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR4.3.2.4   5 62">4.3.2.4 MULTILEVEL SECURITY MODE</A></H5>The 
multilevel security mode allows two or more classification levels of information 
to be processed simultaneously within the same system, when not all users have a 
clearance or formal access approval for all data handled by the AIS. These 
controls are applied in varying degrees, depending on the sensitivity of the 
information and the users' clearances.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.4   3 62">4.4 COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS</A></H3>The Cost Benefit 
Analysis helps to ensure that the security protection features selected for an 
AIS are cost effective. Nevertheless, this does not mean "low-dollar" or least 
expensive. The selected countermeasures must be effective, provide a measure of 
utility, overlap other countermeasures where possible, and have reasonable 
costs. Although cost benefit analysis is identified as a risk management 
function in DoD Directive 5200.28, further discussion about the subject may not 
be found elsewhere in regulatory security documentation. Security is achieved by 
a combination of software and hardware functions, administrative procedures, 
personnel clearances, and physical security measures. The DAA determines the 
required balance of system functions and manual procedures as part of risk 
management. Cost is important in these decisions.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.4.1   4 63">4.4.1 PERFORMING THE ANALYSIS</A></H4>The analysis 
should assess the net security protection capabilities of alternative sets of 
countermeasures. This analysis will ensure that appropriate trade-offs between 
internal and external security protection features are considered. The 
assessment is largely qualitative, with some degree of subjectivity. It is a way 
to "force" consideration of alternative countermeasure sets, but should only be 
used to help make decisions, since the most important attribute of a security 
protection feature is its effectiveness.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.4.2   4 63">4.4.2 SATISFYiNG SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</A></H4>The 
mix of safeguards must meet the minimum security requirements through either 
automated or manual means, in a cost-effective and integrated manner. Other, 
less expensive safeguards may be substituted as long as the required level of 
system security or protection is attained, as determined by the DAA.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.4.3   4 63">4.4.3 RELATION TO SYSTEM LEVEL 
ANALYSES</A></H4>DoD Instruction 5000.2 (Part 4) discusses cost and operational 
effectiveness analysis. Measures of effectiveness gauge the utility of an 
approach, whereas cost analysis assesses the resource implications. The concept 
of life-cycle cost is important. Costs of developing, procuring, operating, and 
supporting system security features must be considered. The cost analysis must 
include staffing, personnel, and training required in support of the security 
solution.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.4.4   4 63">4.4.4 EXAMPLES OF 
TRADEOFFS</A></H4>Cost-effectiveness comparisons must be made. Choice of 
security mode involves trading off cost and risk of additional clearances and 
procedures against the cost and risk of more sophisticated safeguards. Mission 
performance must also be considered. Reduced automated processing of higher 
levels or exclusion of users with low clearance levels may impact mission 
performance. The decision to use a guard to downgrade contaminated data has 
cost, risk, and performance implications. Options, whereby the computer first 
supports one level and then is sanitized and supports another level (called 
periods processing), can also present operational limitations and delay.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.5   3 63">4.5 THREAT ASSESSMENT</A></H3>The intelligence and 
threat support process driven by DoD Instruction 5000.2 provides procedures 
keyed to acquisition milestones. Recommended procedures can have significant 
value in the development of security countermeasures for AISs. When applied to 
the acquisition of AISs, they permit a logical and orderly look at emerging 
technical threats, concurrent with the emergence of system definition. This 
process eliminates the possibility of applying today's (and yesterday's) threat 
to tomorrow's acquisitions, as is often the case with AIS acquisitions. The 
System Threat Assessment Report is one successful threat assessment tool 
promulgated in DoD Instruction 5000.2.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.5.1   4 64">4.5.1 THE SYSTEM THREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT 
(STAR)</A></H4>A threat assessment is required for all major programs, and 
should be initiated for all programs that will process highly classified data or 
are vital to the Organization's mission. The STAR documents the spectrum of 
threats against ASs. The intelligence community prepares the STAR and Defense 
Intelligence Agency (DIA) validates it. For the intelligence community to 
consider all relevant threats, certain essential documentation needs to be 
provided, with as much detail as is currently available. Table 4-2 lists the 
required input to the STAR.

<H4><A name="HDR4.5.2   4 64">4.5.2 FORWARDING THE INFORMATION</A></H4>As 
prescribed by DIA Regulation 55-3, "System Threat Assessment Report," the 
documentation cited above should be assembled and forwarded through the DAA and 
command channels to the Special Security Office, which will in turn send it to 
applicable organizations in the intelligence Community. Emerging ASs often 
present exploitation opportunities to foreign intelligent services and foreign 
commercial interests that are not present in weapon systems in the battlefield 
environment. Unfortunately, the current description of the STAR is keyed to 
weapon system development and focuses on future battlefield threats. Some slight 
changes to the DoD 5000.2-M guidance can help to rectify this situation. 
Suggested changes provided in Table 4-3, specifically addressing emerging AIS's, 
are taken from an ongoing U.S. Army effort.

<P>
<H3><A name="HDR4.6   3 66">4.6 RISK ANALYSIS</A></H3>From DoD Directive 
5200.28," The accreditation of an AIS shall be supported by a risk analysis of 
the AIS in its operational environment. The risk analysis is an analysis of a 
System's assets and vulnerabilities to establish an expected loss from certain 
events." The purpose is to determine if safeguards are adequate to contain 
potential losses within acceptable limits. Risk is classically determined by 
summed products of risk to an asset from a threat over some time period (e.g., 
annually), the value of the asset, the predicted frequency of occurrence of 
threat, and the percentage of the asset that could be effectively destroyed, 
compromised, delayed, or denied by the threat.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.6.1   4 66">4.6.1 DIFFICULTIES</A></H4>Problems arise by a) 
trying to determine values of non-tangible assets (e.g., classified data), b) 
trying to determine a reasonable frequency of occurrence from a malicious 
attacker whose primary weapon is surprise, and c) trying to predict the amount 
of damage that could actually occur from an attack, which is a function of 
safeguards, the attacker's capability, the attacker's motive, and chance. (For 
example, the use of self propagating code usually has unpredictable effects.)
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR4.6.2   4 66">4.6.2 PERFORMING A SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS</A></H4>If 
the DAA cannot locate a suitable risk model, the analysis must deal with the 
same factors, but in a more subjective fashion. The hacker threat, for example, 
has predictability in terms of the common viruses. Simple protection approaches 
are available, but each time a new, more sophisticated threat arises, the 
defense process begins again. There is no history, and therefore no knowledge, 
concerning a highly sophisticated attack against DoD command and control 
installations, but the potential is well understood.

this guideline, the principal concern is with the COMPUSEC features specified 
after considering and specifying the non-COMPUSEC safeguards. Acquisition is the 
vehicle by which the COMPUSEC safeguard selection is accomplished. A contractor 
is selected from those companies bidding. That contractor proceeds to design,

maintainers) have sufficient clearance or authorization to provide an acceptable 
presumption that they have not introduced malicious logic," and b) "whether or 
not configuration control provides sufficient assurance that applications are 
protected against the introduction of malicious logic prior to and during the 
operation of system applications." Enclosure 4 of DoD Directive 5200.28 does not 
use this factor and takes the conservative approach of mandating what was 
previously the "open environment" table. This is the same as saying that current 
state-of-the-art configuration control and personnel security procedures are not 
adequate to protect against the insertion of malicious logic. Nevertheless, 
configuration control does not erase the need to achieve closed development 
environments. It points out the importance of decreasing development risk in all 
ways possible.

<H4><A name="HDR4.7.3   4 67">4.7.3 REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO 
DEVELOPMENT</A></H4>Enclosure 3 of DoD Directive 5200.28 states a strong minimum 
security requirement for the developmenb'implementation environment that must be 
reflected in the acquisition process. Under paragraph 4, Physical Controls: "AIS 
hardware, software and documentation shall be protected to prevent unauthorized 
disclosure, destruction, or modification. Unclassified hardware, software, or 
documentation of an AIS shall be protected if access to such hardware, software, 
or documentation reveals classified information, or access provides information 
that may be used to eliminate circumvent, or otherwise render ineffective the 
security safeguards for classified information. Software development and related 
activities shall be controlled by physical controls (e.g., two person control) 
and protected when it is determined that the software shall be used for handling 
classified or sensitive unclassified data."

<H3><A name="HDR5.1   3 69">5.1 INTRODUCTION</A></H3>Testing is one of the most 
important requirements to consider in an AIS acquisition. Testing is the chief 
way to ensure the security protection features satisfy requirements, whether 
provided internally or externally. This chapter introduces some of the language 
and concepts of Security Test and Evaluation (ST&amp;E), an important step in 
the security risk management process.
<P>

<H4><A name="HDR5.2.1   4 69">5.2.1 TERMS</A></H4>The terms used in this chapter 
are defined below. A more detailed discussion of the processes will be given 
later.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.1.1   5 69">5.2.1.1 EVALUATION</A></H5>Evaluation is the 
assessment for conformance with a pre-established metric, criteria, or standard. 
Security evaluation provides an essential part of the technical evidence 
required for certification and accreditation. NSA is responsible for evaluating 
commercial products. Systems are evaluated as part of the certification process. 
If systems contain NSA-evaluated products, the result of the NSA evaluation can 
be used as evidence.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.1.2   5 69">5.2.1.2 SECURITY TEST AND 
EVALUATION</A></H5>ST&amp;E is a process used to determine if a system's 
security protection features meet its specification requirements. The process 
requires documenting and reporting test findings and making recommendations to 
appropriate authorities based on test results.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.1.3   5 70">5.2.1.3 ENDORSE</A></H5>To endorse means to 
sanction or to approve for use. The accreditation process may lead to an 
endorsement of a system under specific operating conditions and in a specific 
environment. "Endorsement" does not apply to COMPUSEC products evaluated by the 
NSA. It only applies to the Endorsed Tools List, used by system developers to 
identify the formal specification and validation tools that are endorsed by the 
NSA for use in designing candidate A1 systems. 
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.2.2   4 70">5.2.2 ST&amp;E AND THE ACQUISITION 
PROCESS</A></H4>ST&amp;E begins early in the system life cycle. ST&amp;E 
includes all the security disciplines (i.e., COMPUSEC, OPSEC, and COMSEC). 
However, in this guideline, concentration is on COMPUSEC. Before any form of 
testing can be defined, system requirements must be clearly established. These 
requirements include the mission the system will perform or support, the 
associated security requirements, the sensitivity level(s) of information to be 
processed, user clearance levels, the security mode(s) of operation, and the 
division/class requirements to be supported. Internal and external controls must 
complement each other. This process requires an integrated test approach to 
examine both the elements and the totality of the system's security features. 
The level of effort required to perform the ST&amp;E is determined by 1) the 
number of requirements to be proven/satisfied, 2) the difficulty in proving that 
they are satisfied, and 3) the acceptable level of residual risk determined by 
the DAA.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.2.3   4 70">5.2.3 USE OF EVALUATED PRODUCTS</A></H4>A primary 
goal of NSA is to encourage the widespread availability of trusted systems. This 
goal is realized, in large measure, through NSA's Trusted Product Evaluation 
Program. This program focuses on the technical evaluation of the protection 
capabilities of commercially produced and supported products. Use of systems or 
system elements evaluated through the NSA program greatly simplifies risk 
analysis, certification, and accreditation. The level of effort required to 
perform the ST&amp;E for an acquisition can be minimized through the use of 
"approved" system products. However, system-level testing will probably not be 
affected by use of such products. Evaluations can be lengthy, delaying the 
availability of the product for use in a trusted application. Sometimes, the EPL 
product version is not the most recent release. These penalties are felt to be 
small compared to the high assurance and reduction in additional testing.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.2.4   4 70">5.2.4 THE EVALUATION PROCESS</A></H4>The NSA 
Trusted Product Evaluation Program focuses on the technical evaluation of the 
protection capabilities of off-the-shelf systems to meet the COMPUSEC needs of 
DoD and other Government organizations and agencies. The standards against which 
products are evaluated are provided by DoD 5200.28-STD, the Trusted Network 
Interpretation (TNI), the Trusted Database Management System Interpretation 
(TDI), and the Computer Security Subsystem Interpretation (CSSI).
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.4.1   5 71">5.2.4.1 THE EVALUATED PRODUCTS LIST</A></H5>The 
product evaluation culminates in the publication of an EPL listing. The 
evaluation is independent of any consideration of overall system performance, 
potential applications, or particular processing environment. The EPL is a 
section in the "Information Systems Security Products and Services Catalogue," 
prepared by and available from NSA. The aim of the EPL is to provide AIS 
developers, managers, and users an authoritative evaluation of a product's 
relative suitability for use in processing sensitive information. The security 
evaluation of a product is also contained in a formal report available to those 
requiring more detail.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.4.2   5 71">5.2.4.2 PRODUCT TYPES</A></H5>Products are 
separated into general-purpose operating systems, add-on packages, and 
subsystems. An add-on package runs in conjunction with a specific operating 
system and is not, by itself, a system that performs all of the functions 
traditionally ascribed to an operating system. Subsystems are special-purpose 
products that can be added to existing ASs to increase security and implement 
only a subset of the security features identified in the procurement criteria. 
The product evaluation program can be thought of as part of the ST&amp;E to the 
extent that evidence of evaluations can be used in the ST&amp;E process.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.2.5   4 71">5.2.5 TEST AND EVALUATION (T&amp;E) AND THE 
LIFE-CYCLE PROCESS</A></H4>There are three independent types of test and 
evaluation involving security testing in the life-cycle of an AIS. During 
Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), technical security measures 
implemented in the hardware and software are tested to determine the degree of 
compliance with specifications. Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) 
addresses security from the operational or user viewpoint, and determines the 
effectiveness and suitability of all security safeguards. ST&amp;E is conducted 
independent of all other T&amp;E activities. It concentrates on the security 
features rather than the entire system. ST&amp;E is also performed as part of 
the risk analysis process to identify threats and vulnerabilities. It uses the 
risk analysis as input and provides results that are used in further risk 
analysis. ST&amp;E supports system certification and accreditation decisions. 
ST&amp;E involvement in the life cycle is as follows:
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.5.1   5 71">5.2.5.1 DETERMINATION OF MISSION 
NEED</A></H5>Mission analysis and associated threat assessments are factored 
into the Program Management Directive and the subsequent Program Management 
Plan. These documents serve to initiate the ST&amp;E activities during Concept 
Exploration. 
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.5.2   5 72">5.2.5.2 CONCEPT EXPLORATION AND 
DEFINITION</A></H5>This phase involves a security-focus review of project plans, 
such as the PMD and PMP, for expected ST&amp;E involvement. Coordination 
interfaces are established with the Designated Approving Authority, Program 
Manager, Test Planning Working Group, and Computer Resources Working Group, as 
well as the DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E organizations. Risk analyses are reviewed and 
documented in various program documents such as the Test and Evaluation Master 
Plan. The System Functional Baseline is established upon successful completion 
of the System Design Review.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.5.3   5 72">5.2.5.3 DEMONSTRATION AND VALIDATION</A></H5>The 
feasibility, risks, alternatives, and trade-offs are assessed during the 
Demonstration and Validation Phase. T&amp;E of computer security features should 
be conducted for prototype system components. By doing so, technical trade-offs 
can be used to strike a balance among acceptable risk, mix of authorized user 
personnel and sensitive data, and the adequacy of security features to meet 
life-cycle requirements. The overall result of this phase includes a refinement 
of the requirements and associated T&amp;E plans, objectives, subobjectives, and 
measures of effectiveness (MOEs). The System Allocated Baseline is established 
at the end of this phase after the Subsystem Requirements Review.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.5.4   5 72">5.2.5.4 ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING 
DEVELOPMENT</A></H5>The development phase includes the bulk of DT&amp;E and 
OT&amp;E activity. Testing individual components, subsystems, and systems is 
conducted on the actual system as it progresses through preliminary design, 
detailed design, production, and integration. Formal verification of COMPUSEC 
features is also accomplished for A1 systems. The impact on performance of 
embedded computer security features is assessed. The results of these tests 
become an input to risk analysis and lead to system certification and 
accreditation. The AIS Product Baseline is established at the end of this phase 
through the Functional Configuration Audit and Physical Configuration Audit 
reviews.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.2.5.5   5 72">5.2.5.5 PRODUCTION AND DEPLOYMENT</A></H5>Upon 
receiving a favorable accreditation decision, the system is fielded in the 
operational environment during this phase. OT&amp;E evaluates the operational 
system in its operational and support environments. Primary security-relevant 
OT&amp;E activities inClude evaluating administrative procedures and management 
functions. Also included are facility planning for physical security, 
contingencies, and assessment of the AIS's internal and external security 
features to ensure proper operation. Results are input to the system security 
certification and accreditation process for Consideration by the DAA for 
approval to operate the system. 
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR5.3   3 73">5.3 THE TESTING PROCESS</A></H3>Responsibilities for 
ST&amp;E are distributed between the Operational unit and its parent 
organization/agency. OT&amp;E usually follows DT&amp;E, but in some cases they 
may overlap or be combined. ST&amp;E is accomplished independently. The 
following paragraphs summarize DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E highlights. Tables 5-1 and 
5-2 show the objectives of DT&amp;E and OT&amp;E, respectively.

<H4><A name="HDR5.3.1   4 74">5.3.1 DEVELOPMENTAL TEST AND 
EVALUATION</A></H4>The implementing command (e.g., the Program Office) must 
demonstrate that the system engineering, design, and development are complete; 
the design risks have been minimized; and the system will perform as required in 
its intended environment. DT&amp;E involves engineering analysis of the system's 
performance, including its limitations and safe operating parameters. The system 
design is tested and evaluated against engineering and performance criteria 
specified to satisfy mission requirements. DT&amp;E also addresses the 
logistics, engineering, and supportability aspects of the system throughout its 
life cycle.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.3.1.1   5 74">5.3.1.1 QUALIFICATION TEST AND EVALUATION 
(QT&amp;E)</A></H5>QT&amp;E is normally performed in lieu of DT&amp;E for 
programs where there is no research and development. These programs might 
include modifications to existing systems, off-the-shelf equipment requiring 
minor modifications, and other systems that require no development. Test 
policies for DT&amp;E apply to QT&amp;E.

<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.3.2   4 74">5.3.2 OPERATIONAL TEST AND 
EVALUATION</A></H4>OT&amp;E is conducted under conditions that represent 
real-life conditions anticipated during the system's life cycle. OT&amp;E 
evaluates (or refines estimates of) a system's operational effectiveness, 
maintainability, supportability, and suitability. This process also requires 
identification of any operational and logistics support deficiencies, and any 
need for modifications.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR5.3.2.1   5 74">5.3.2.1 INITIAL OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION 
(IOT&amp;E)</A></H5>IOT&amp;E usually begins as early as possible in a system's 
development. IOT&amp;E is structured to provide inputs to the remaining program 
decisions (e.g., certification). IOT&amp;E is accomplished using prototypes, 
preproduction devices, or pilot production components. IOT&amp;E must be 
completed prior to the full-rate production decision to ensure the system is 
ready for production.

<H5><A name="HDR5.3.2.3   5 75">5.3.2.3 FOLLOW-ON OPERATIONAL TEST AND 
EVALUATION (FOT&amp;E)</A></H5>FOT&amp;E is operational testing conducted after 
the full-rate production decision. FOT&amp;E may also be conducted as needed 
throughout the remainder of the AIS's life-cycle to assess changes in workload 
and performance.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR5.4   3 75">5.4 PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING THE 
ST&amp;E</A></H3>Thus far, there has been a discussion of the ST&amp;E in 
general and its relationship to the rest of the testing process. This portion of 
the chapter addresses contractual actions necessary to ensure the ST&amp;E is 
addressed within the overall T&amp;E process. Advance planning, determining what 
should be tested, determining how testing should be performed, and reporting 
test results are prime considerations. Although the focus is on contractor 
actions, the Government is still deeply involved in ST&amp;E. Further, in some 
instances, the Government may do some of the testing in lieu of tasking a 
contractor. Regardless, the Government should always review and participate in 
all aspects of T&amp;E.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.4.1   4 75">5.4.1 TEST AND EVALUATION MASTER PLAN 
(TEMP)</A></H4>The TEMP is the primary planning document for T&amp;E. The TEMP 
is required for all acquisitions. The TEMP should describe the T&amp;E strategy, 
responsibilities, types of testing, required resources, planned test locations, 
and milestone schedules. The TEMP is a living document and must be updated as 
changes occur. From the security standpoint, the ST&amp;E must be explicitly 
addressed in the TEMP. This is done by tasking the Contractor in the Statement 
of Work and invoking a CDRL that calls for an a ST&amp;E Annex to the TEMP. A 
matrix can be used to identify selected security disciplines to be tested.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.4.2   4 75">5.4.2 TEST PLANS</A></H4>Whereas the TEMP is an 
overall planning and scheduling document, specific operational test scenarios 
and events are covered by development and operational test plans. The test 
plan(s) for ST&amp;E, like other T&amp;E plans, should include test objectives; 
MOEs; planned operational scenarios; detailed resource requirements; known test 
limitations; and methods of data gathering, reduction, and analysis. Table 5-3 
indicates desired MOE/MOP(Measure of Performance) characteristics. 
<P>Table 5-3 Desired MOE/MOP Characteristics
<P>Sensitivity - Should be sensitive to all potentially significant variables.
<P>Precision - Precise definition is desired to reduce probability of 
misunderstanding of implications. Penetration testing may be a challenge due to 
prevalent mindsets. There should be no ambiguities concerning what is being 
measured and the conditions of measurement.
<P>Feasible Scope - Must not be too broad. For example, a measure for 
configuration control for a TCB should probably be broken into several measures 
for change control of DTLS, source code, object code, and implementation 
documentation.
<P>Independence - Measures should be mutually exclusive to avoid the resultant 
overweighting of impact(s).
<P>Meaningful - Should be expressed in terms meaningful to the review authority 
and decision makers (e.g., DAA). This may be a challenge due to technical 
complexity and or diversity and scope of AIS administration, system 
administration, or facility provisions.
<P>Measurable - COMPUSEC MOEs/MOPs and their inputs must be measurable to be 
evaluated. T&amp;E for message or data labeling, for example, may require the 
capture and recording of data, indicating actual versus correct labeling.
<P>Quantifiable - C0MPUSEC measures should be quantifiable, where possible, to 
avoid unnecessary subjectivity. However, this does not imply avoidance of 
critical inputs. Carefully designed questionnaires can gain information from 
C0MPUSEC test personnel on subjects such as resistance to penetration, COMPUSEC 
performance versus specifications, potential weak links, or areas for 
effectiveness improvement or cost savings. Also, some otherwise valid measures 
may not be quantifiable, such as the confidence to be placed in a trusted 
subject. Analysis may instead be supported by some quantifiable data such as for 
populations having the same psychological profile and/or clearance level.
<P>Exhaustive - All protective measures in the AIS, administration, and facility 
must be assessed against variable conditions capable of impacting performance.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR5.4.3   4 76">5.4.3 TEST REPORTS</A></H4>The final topic of the 
test discussion is reporting. Test reports are prepared to document the results 
of test plan execution. Test reports also identify test objectives, describe the 
tests conducted, and provide recommendations stemming from test results.

<H5><A name="HDR6.2.1.1   5 78">6.2.1.1 CERTIFICATION</A></H5>Certification is 
the technical evaluation of an AIS's security features and other safeguards, 
made in support of the accreditation process. The technical evaluation 
establishes the extent to which a particular AIS design and implementation 
satisfies or complies with specified security requirements. Security 
requirements are derived from and implemented to negate known, expected, and 
perceived threats.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.2.1.2   5 79">6.2.1.2 ACCREDITATION</A></H5>Accreditation is a 
formal declaration by the DAA that the AIS is approved to operate in a 
particular security mode, in a given operational environment, in a specified 
configuration, and using a prescribed set of safeguards. Accreditation is the 
official management authorization for operation of an AlS and is based on the 
certification process as well as other management considerations. The 
accreditation statement affixes security responsibility with the DAA and shows 
that due care has been taken for security.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.2.2   4 79">6.2.2 THE PROCESS</A></H4>Each major activity in 
the risk management process has several subactivities (which may overlap or be 
completed out of sequence). Table 6-1 shows this process. Hardware and software 
provide some, but not all, security protection measures. Other security measures 
may include physical, administrative, personnel, and procedural steps. Analysis 
of the system development process (configuration management) and support systems 
(test tools, training tools, development tools) must be included in the 
certification and accreditation activities. The hardware and operating system 
software provide the core of internally enforced security protection features of 
the system. The computer system application software provides the functionality 
and implements mission requirements.

<H3><A name="HDR6.3   3 80">6.3 METHODOLOGY</A></H3>Figure 6-1 shows the 
certification and accreditation processes. The essence of Certification is a 
technical evaluation of security protection features against security 
requirements. In contrast, accreditation is a management decision based on the 
risk of employing the computer system in an operational environment. Thus, 
accreditation differs from certification since accreditation is more subjective, 
while certification is largely objective. Moreover, accreditation decisions 
require mandatory compliance, whereas certification statements are 
recommendations to the DAA. A similar methodology can be used for both 
accreditation and certification, but subtle differences exits. An organized and 
carefully thought-out methodology will enhance successful certification and 
accreditation.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.3.1   4 80">6.3.1 TEAM APPROACH</A></H4>Program Managers 
assigned to a large program office will have the support of a variety of people. 
These people will be crucial to technical evaluations or reviews of the 
contractor's work. A one-person office or small program office will require 
enlisting the support of other people. Others may include investigative 
organizations (e.g., security police), personnel administrators, computer 
systems analysts, and systems programmers. The certification team is usually 
composed primarily of technical experts. DoD is strongly considering the use of 
trained certification teams to provide uniform and rigorous certification 
evaluation, similar to current product evaluation. For accreditation, some 
technical expertise is necessary, but emphasis will shift to a mission 
orientation. The DAA will normally be someone from the user organization, but 
may be higher in the organization, or the owner of the protected data. 
Therefore, the functional user and the implementing organization must be well 
represented.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.3.2   4 81">6.3.2 GOVERNMENT OR CONTRACTOR 
PERSONNEL</A></H4>The Government often has insufficient resources to perform 
certifications and therefore, supplements its staff with contractor personnel. 
Each program will use a different mix of personnel, but the resulting package of 
documents will be substantially the same, independent of the mix. This mix makes 
planning and coordination one of the most important functions.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.3.3   4 81">6.3.3 ITERATIVE PROCESS</A></H4>The entire process 
(certification or accreditation) is iterative since, based on the findings from 
each step, previous steps may need to be re-examined. Moreover, some aspects of 
each step may need to proceed at the same time, perhaps by different evaluators. 
Again, the role of coordinator becomes very important. In accreditation, because 
the final decision can be postponed (e.g., interim versus final), the process 
could continue for much longer than scheduled.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.3.4   4 81">6.3.4 STRATEGY</A></H4>The basic strategy should 
be to develop a comprehensive plan, get all the players to agree (most 
importantly the DAA), and then execute the plan. When completed, the result will 
be a package to be taken to the certifying official or DAA for review and 
approval.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR6.4   3 81">6.4 CERTIFICATION</A></H3>The certification process 
ideally begins when the computer system acquisition is conceived, and continues 
throughout the system's life-cycle. Certification occurs when the certifying 
official Signs a letter stating the system security protection features have 
been evaluated and found to be adequate and correct. The letter signed by the 
certifying official typically has a number of attachments, including risk 
analyses, test reports, security features, residual risks, cost/benefit 
analysis, and others. Completion and compilation of the attachments in the 
certification package involve the Program Manager. The certification team leader 
should carefully determine the number, scope, and applicability of the documents 
to meet the certification requirements.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.4.1   4 81">6.4.1 KEY ELEMENTS</A></H4>The Certification 
Package has two key elements: analysis of the security features and the 
supporting documentation.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.4.1.1   5 82">6.4.1.1 ANALYSIS OF SECURITY 
FEATURES</A></H5>The technical analysis of the security features is the basis 
for certification. A report documents the results of the analysis, with the 
following objectives:
<P>a. To document the adequacy and correctness of the security protection 
features in satisfying security requirements. This process involves comparing 
the "build to" (design) configuration to the "as built" (installed or 
implemented) configuration. 
<P>b. To assess supporting documentation completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency. 
<P>c. To identify latent system security vulnerabilities discovered in this 
evaluation. Countermeasure(s) will be recommended and the acceptability of the 
associated risk(s) will be assessed if countermeasures are not applied.
<P>d. To reveal limitations or restrictions necessary for the computer system to 
meet acceptable risk when the system is fielded and functioning in the selected 
security mode of operation.
<P>e. To present recommendation(s) based on conclusion(s) derived from the 
evaluation.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.4.1.2   5 82">6.4.1.2 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION</A></H5>The 
Certification Package, whether prepared by the Government or the contractor, 
must contain a set of supporting documents. These documents are necessary since 
they "prove," or provide tangible evidence, that necessary actions have been 
completed. The certification team leader should carefully determine the number, 
scope, and applicability of the documents to match the certification 
requirements. Only necessary documents that address residual risk will be 
required for each computer system to be accredited. A statement should be 
included in the certification letter identifying the supporting documentation 
being provided. It is recommended that a minimum set of attachments accompany 
the certification letter submitted to the DAA. The certification package should 
contain documentation that will not only assist in the DAA making the decision 
to operate, but also assist any future recertification and reaccreditation of 
this system or a similar system. Table 6-2 identifies the supporting documents.

<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.4.1.3   5 83">6.4.1.3 SUPPLEMENTARY 
DOCUMENTATION</A></H5>Several other documents are not technically part of the 
Certification Support package; however, they are necessary for background 
material (e.g., test plans), to demonstrate the computer system is ready for the 
field (e.g., Trusted Facility Manual), or to prepare for the next phase, 
accreditation. Not every document will be required for each computer system 
program. In that case, a statement should be included attesting to a document's 
non-applicability. Table 6-3 lists the supplementary documents.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.4.2   4 83">6.4.2 GOVERNMENT-CONDUCTED CERTIFICATION 
ACTIVITIES</A></H4>For a program in which the Government will be doing the bulk

<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.4.2.1   5 84">6.4.2.1 PLANNING</A></H5>Planning tasks include:
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.1.1   6 84">6.4.2.1.1 HIGH-LEVEL REVIEWS</A></H6>The plans 
should require certification analysts to perform high-level reviews of the 
entire system or application to gain an understanding of the security-relevant 
issues involved. The plan should also define problem areas and anticipate the 
need for specialized skills.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.1.2   6 84">6.4.2.1.2 PLACING BOUNDARIES ON THE 
EFFORT</A></H6>During the planning phase, boundaries must be defined for all 
facets of the system and application environment. This includes the 
administrative, physical, and technical areas. Without this comprehensive review 
and bounding, the results might give an incomplete, and perhaps misleading, 
picture of the security posture of the system or application.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.1.3   6 85">6.4.2.1.3 PARTITIONING THE WORK AMONG 
AVAILABLE ANALYSTS</A></H6>A certification project is usually partitioned based 
on the analysts' specialized skills.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.1.4   6 85">6.4.2.1.4 SCHEDULING AND 
PLANNING</A></H6>Scheduling of tasking must be established so as to ensure 
availability of personnel, facilities, and necessary resources. Careful planning 
will reduce scheduling conflicts and delays in accomplishing testing.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.1.5   6 85">6.4.2.1.5 IDENTIFYING AREAS TO 
EMPHASIZE</A></H6>The planning emphasis should be directed to areas having a 
greater potential for loss of, or risk to, sensitive information. These areas 
may have been identified in an earlier risk analysis, problems identified during 
testing, or in reports of past problems with similar systems.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.1.6   6 85">6.4.2.1.6 SKETCHING OUT THE DOCUMENTATION 
REQUIREMENTS</A></H6>The data collected during the planning phase forms the 
basis for meeting the documentation requirements of the certification process. 
Specific attention should be paid to security requirements, evaluation approach, 
evaluation team composition, tasks and schedule, required support, and 
certification products and reports.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.1.7   6 85">6.4.2.1.7 ASSUMPTIONS AND 
CONSTRAINTS</A></H6>The quality and availability of the required documentation, 
access to or availability of the system for the C&amp;A team, the Program 
Manager's schedule, and training of C&amp;A team members, should be addressed.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.4.2.2   5 85">6.4.2.2 DATA COLLECTION</A></H5>The ideal source 
of information is existing system documentation. However, there are occasions 
when the necessary documentation does not exist or is not in a form to be 
readily analyzed. An efficient technique for gathering information is for 
application personnel to provide briefings to the certification team. Document 
reviews and interviews are also often needed to expand upon and corroborate the 
information found during the evaluation. Critically needed documents deal with 
issues in Table 6-4.

<P>System application or security requirements
<P>Risk analyses portraying threats

<P>Accreditation package(s) from external systems to include residual risks
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.4.2.3   5 86">6.4.2.3 CERTIFICATION EVALUATION</A></H5>Four 
major tasks comprise a basic certification evaluation, they are as follows:
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.3.1   6 86">6.4.2.3.1 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS 
EVALUATION</A></H6>A security requirements evaluation is important because 
certification is more accurate if the application or system has well-defined 
security requirements. This task critiCally examines the security measures 
documentation for compliance with National, DoD, and user security policy and 
protection safeguard requirements. Four primary areas must be considered when 
defining system or application safeguards: assets, exposure potentials, threats, 
and controls. The risk analysis may define many of the security safeguards. 
Other useful evaluation tools include computer security checklists and 
questionnaires.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.3.2   6 86">6.4.2.3.2 SECURITY PROTECTION FEATURE 
EVALUATION</A></H6>A security protection feature evaluation determines whether 
security features or functions such as access authorizations, operational usage 
monitoring, password generation and management, and sensitivity indication 
labeling, satisfy all current security requirements. Ill-defined requirements 
cause this part of the overall evaluation to become the most important task in 
the basic evaluation. The primary evaluation method is use of a checklist based 
on the stated requirements. Detail should be given to the functional 
specification level.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.3.3   6 86">6.4.2.3.3 SECURITY CONTROL 
IMPLEMENTATION</A></H6>Security functions described in the documentation must be 
properly implemented. The existence of physical and administrative controls can 
be confirmed by inspection, but assurance for internal controls requires 
testing. In some cases, a brief demonstration may be all that is required; in 
other instances, elaborate tests must be devised, validated, and conducted to 
gain the necessary assurances.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.4.2.3.4   6 87">6.4.2.3.4 METHODOLOGY REVIEW</A></H6>One way 
to determine whether security controls have been properly implemented is to 
examine the methodology used to design and develop the system or application. 
Several areas of concern exist when reviewing a system or an application 
development methodology for certification: documentation, objectives, project 
control, tools and techniques, and resources.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.4.2.4   5 87">6.4.2.4 REPORT OF FINDINGS</A></H5>The Report of 
Findings is the primary outcome of the certification process. The certification 
official has the Opportunity, not only to report evaluation results to the DAA, 
but to explain the potential ramifications of the findings in terms of risk to 
the system. Recommendations can be made to correct deficiencies temporarily or 
permanently and identify the potential security risk ramifications. Based on the 
recommendations of FIPS PUB 102, another recommendation can be to conduct a more 
detailed certification evaluation in particular areas, where the certifying 
official feels that the current evaluation was inadequate.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.4.2.5   5 87">6.4.2.5 CLASSIFICATION OF FINDINGS</A></H5>The 
disclosure of information which, if exploited, could impact the mission of a 
system or allow security features to be bypassed, must be protected from 
disclosure to unauthorized persons.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR6.5   3 87">6.5 ACCREDITATION</A></H3>Accreditation is based on 
the premise that a single individual, the DAA, is the accreditor. He/she 
exercises management's prerogative to grant (or deny) authority for a computer 
system to process actual mission data in an operational environment.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.5.1   4 87">6.5.1 CONSIDERATIONS</A></H4>In making the 
accreditation decision, the DAA considers a number of factors: 
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.1.1   5 87">6.5.1.1 THE MISSION</A></H5>The DAA's first 
concern is for operational mission requirements to be met.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.1.2   5 87">6.5.1.2 THE THREAT</A></H5>There will always be 
threats to sensitive information. The threats, coupled with the system's 
vulnerabilities, provide the risks upon which to focus the security protection 
features.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.1.3   5 87">6.5.1.3 THE COUNTERMEASURES</A></H5>Adequacy of 
the security protection features in countering identified threat vulnerability 
pairs will be determined.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.1.4   5 88">6.5.1.4 THE RISK</A></H5>Residual risks will be 
assumed by the DAA if the computer system is approved for operation.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.1.5   5 88">6.5.1.5 THE COST</A></H5>The costs to reduce 
residual risk could be in terms of dollars, schedule, performance, or other 
resources.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.5.2   4 88">6.5.2 KEY ELEMENTS</A></H4>Like certification, the 
two key elements to the accreditation decision package are assessment of risk 
and the supporting documentation.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.2.1   5 88">6.5.2.1 ASSESSMENT OF RISK</A></H5>The 
subjective assessment of risks associated with employing the AIS is the basis 
for accreditation. The results of the assessment are documented in a report with 
the following objectives:
<P>a. To assess the security risks associated with employing the AIS. This 
assessment should include normal operations, degraded mode operations, and
<P>stressed operations.
<P>b. To evaluate the supporting documentation in terms of completeness, 
accuracy, and consistency.
<P>c. To identify and evaluate any latent system security vulnerabilities 
discovered and recommend countermeasures, or assess the acceptability of the 
associated risks.
<P>d. Identify any limitations or restrictions necessary for acceptable risk 
when the computer system is fielded and functioning in the selected security 
mode of operation. Identify the basis for provisional or interim accreditation, 
if applicable.
<P>e. Document any action items necessary to achieve a favorable accreditation 
decision.
<P>f. Provide conclusions and recommendations based on this assessment.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.2.2   5 89">6.5.2.2 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION</A></H5>The 
Accreditation Package, whether prepared by the Government or the contractor, 
must contain a set of supporting documents. Table 6-5 lists this documentation.

<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.5.3   4 89">6.5.3 CONTRACTOR-PROVIDED ACCREDITATION 
SUPPORT</A></H4>For an acquisition in which a contractor will provide the 
accreditation package, the approach is nearly the same as for certification. The 
contractor needs to be given contacts and documents on the accreditation 
requirements and his role.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.3.1   5 89">6.5.3.1 STATEMENT OF WORK TASKS</A></H5>Include 
two Statement of Work tasks in the RFP:
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.5.3.1.1   6 89">6.5.3.1.1 ACCREDITATION PLAN</A></H6>Require 
the contractor to deliver to the Government a plan documenting the actions 
necessary to achieve computer system accreditation.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.5.3.1.2   6 90">6.5.3.1.2 ACCREDITATION

deliver an Accreditation Support Package to the Government.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.3.2   5 90">6.5.3.2 GOVERNMENT REVIEW</A></H5>Again, review 
the contractor's submissions for completeness, accuracy, and reasOnableness. 
Comments provided back to the contractor must be ensured to represent a

<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.5.3.2.1   6 90">6.5.3.2.1 ACCREDITATION PLAN</A></H6>Ensure 
the planned actions "track" with the system security specifications and the 
computer system program operational environment. Planned actions must be 
coordinated with a variety of offices so there are no surprises later as the

functional area experts in various disciplines.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.3.3   5 90">6.5.3.3 BRIEFING</A></H5>The DAA will probably 
expect to be given a briefing before making a decision. Whether this briefing is 
prepared by the contractor or internally, the content of the Accreditation 
Support Package should provide the information.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.5.4   4 90">6.5.4 GOVERNMENT-CONDUCTED ACCREDITATION 
ACTIVITIES</A></H4>In a program in which the Government will be doing the bulk 
of the accreditation effort, follow the same approach outlined for a contractor.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR6.5.5   4 90">6.5.5 MANAGING PROBLEMS</A></H4>Since systems or 
applications requiring certification and accreditation are usually vital to an 
organization's mission, some problems discovered may not be severe enough to 
remove or delay the system or application from operational use. If the problems 
are major, alternatives are available for authorizing operational use. The 
choice of alternatives depends on the nature of the problem and the operational 
mission.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.5.1   5 90">6.5.5.1 THE DECISION</A></H5>The following 
accreditation decisions could be made:
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.5.5.1.1   6 90">6.5.5.1.1 GRANT FULL OPERATIONAL 
AUTHORITY</A></H6>In this case, no restrictions apply.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.5.5.1.2   6 91">6.5.5.1.2 GRANT CONDITIONAL OPERATIONAL 
AUTHORITY</A></H6>Here, permission to Operate might be for a temporary time 
period, or require additional security protection features (e.g., until security 
feature "X,' is corrected, tested, and certified, no information more sensitive 
than "Y" can be processed).
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR6.5.5.1.3   6 91">6.5.5.1.3 GRANT LIMITED OPERATIONAL 
AUTHORITY</A></H6>In some instances, authority to operate might be restricted to 
a specific operational circumstance or mode (e.g., only during crisis, or only 
in the Dedicated Security Mode).
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR6.5.5.2   5 91">6.5.5.2 CAVEATS</A></H5>When systems must be 
operated with major problems, conditional or limited authority may be granted. 
This is an interim measure only, pending implementation of additional security 
features. A review schedule and continuing oversight is necessary to ensure 
conditions of the interim accreditation are adhered to, and additional security 
features to be implemented are not forgotten.
<P>

<H2><A name="HDR7   2 94">7 MANAGING THE ACQUISITION OF SECURE SYTEMS</A></H2>
<H3><A name="HDR7.1   3 94">7.1 INTRODUCTION</A></H3>At this point of the 
document, it becomes apparent that many program tasks are performed by people 
other than the Program Manager. Since there is a security "thread" running 
through all portions of the program, other activities may either directly or 
indirectly affect the security arena. Chapter 2, The Acquisition Process, 
provided an overview of four separate, but interrelated "chains of management" 
associated with an acquisition. This chapter will focus on the Program 
Management chain, its associated elements and documents, and its application to 
secure systems. It will show how those responsible for security will support 
Program Management in this acquisition. This chapter also covers the basic 
life-cycle phases of a project, and identifies the security-relevant data 
deliverables. Appendix B summarizes plans and deliverable documents.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR7.2   3 94">7.2 MANAGEMENT POLICY AND OBJECTIVES</A></H3>DoD 
Directive 7920.1, Life-Cycle Management of Automated Information Systems, 
contains the DoD automated information system management policies and 
objectives. Policies and objectives should be considered while addressing 
security for any automated information system acquisition.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.2.1   4 94">7.2.1 POLICY</A></H4>The key management policy 
regarding security states that the design, development, acquisition, operation, 
and management of an automated information system must meet security policy 
directives and regulations, while at the same time meeting mission requirements.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.2.2   4 95">7.2.2 OBJECTIVES</A></H4>The Program Manager's 
role is a direct result of the DoD's concern for security. The Program Manager 
is the person who must ensure security protection requirements are satisfied 
during an automated information system acquisition.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.2.3   4 95">7.2.3 THE FUTURE</A></H4>In the future, functional 
users will increasingly state their requirements for "trusted" automated 
information systems. In response, the DoD will have to be part of the 
"leading-edge" of technology as it strives to meet both functional user 
operational requirements and mandates for security. It is important for the 
Program Manager to get to know the user early.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.2.4   4 95">7.2.4 USER EDUCATION</A></H4>A major procurement 
responsibility is to educate functional users so they understand how both their 
operational and security requirements will be met. This can be accomplished 
through user awareness and training.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR7.3   3 95">7.3 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES</A></H3>
<H4><A name="HDR7.3.1   4 95">7.3.1 PLANNING</A></H4>Automated information 
system planning is like all other planning activities. Planning is required to 
meet policies and objectives and is the first step necessary to compete for and 
to get approved resources. The planning process must be kept in mind for several 
reasons:
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.3.1.1   5 95">7.3.1.1 HOW THE PROGRAM MADE IT THIS 
FAR</A></H5>Proper planning (or the lack thereof) has evolved the automated 
information system program to its current point in time.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.3.1.2   5 95">7.3.1.2 INADEQUATE RESOURCES</A></H5>Competing 
for funds and resolving "disconnects" is difficult. Resources necessary to 
satisfy the security issues not properly addressed at program inception are 
likely to cause iteration of the planning phase and could even result in serious 
delays.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.3.1.3   5 95">7.3.1.3 HEADS-UP</A></H5>The long range planning 
documents help all planners understand future requirements. Proper inputs during 
the cyclical document updates will ensure the program gets the resources and 
solutions for security requirements it needs.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.3.2   4 95">7.3.2 MANAGEMENT</A></H4>Program management is a 
necessary ingredient for any acquisition. There are two primary objectives:
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.3.2.1   5 96">7.3.2.1 CONTROL MECHANISM</A></H5>First, program 
management establishes controls to ensure automated information system 
operational requirements are developed on time and within budget. These controls 
are provided through a system of checks and balances. Since the approach for 
"trusted" systems is a recent technology, it may involve acquiring a unique or 
"tailored" product (this usually translates into a more "costly" product). Until 
the technology matures, the level of effort required to bring a "trusted" system 
into the organizational inventory will be considerable, dictating sound program 
management tools and controls.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.3.2.2   5 96">7.3.2.2 LIFE-CYCLE SUPPORT</A></H5>The second 
program management objective is to ensure program support throughout the 
life-Cycle. This may entail millions of dollars and hundreds of people.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.3.3   4 96">7.3.3 COMMUNICATION</A></H4>The program manager 
must recognize that the key to a successful program is early and continuing 
communication among security people, and between security and systems people. 
The primary elements affected by program management are systems engineering, 
configuration management, and test and evaluation management. Since a major 
impetus behind a "trusted" automated information system acquisition is security, 
the Program Manager will be heavily involved in all three of these program 
management elements.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.3.3.1   5 96">7.3.3.1 SECURITY MANAGEMENT</A></H5>DoD 
Instruction 5000.2, Part 5F deals with security during development. Part 6J 
addresses security in the design. The Program Manager can expect to be tasked to 
work many of these items or processes. He/she should review this document 
keeping the security "thread" in mind. The Program Manager may be the Security 
Manager or another person appointed to fill the slot. The rest of this chapter 
will refer to the Security Manager when security management activities are 
discussed.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.3.3.2   5 96">7.3.3.2 TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR 
CONTRACTS</A></H5>The contracting officer is not usually technically qualified 
in the intricacies of security in an automated information system acquisition. 
Therefore, the Security Manager may expect to be tasked as a Contracting Officer 
Technical Representative (COTR) on security-relevant issues.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.3.4   4 96">7.3.4 COORDINATION</A></H4>There will be extensive 
coordination with other agencies for both the program manager and the security 
manager.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.3.4.1   5 97">7.3.4.1 STANDARD AUTOMATED INFORMATION SYSTEM 
ASSETS</A></H5>Certain systems have been designated as "standard" automated 
information systems. These standard systems are generally defined as automated 
information systems serving more than one organization. These systems must be 
coordinated at a higher command level or with an organization specifically 
tasked for their management. Coordination with other organizations will be 
required if the program interfaces with one or more of these standard systems.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.3.4.1.1   6 97">7.3.4.1.1 LEAD-TIMES</A></H6>Some of the 
lead-times for specific standard systems can be quite lengthy. As a minimum, the 
Program Manager should check for any requirements to link with or use AUTODIN, 
military service telecommunications systems, DDN, DCS, leased long-haul 
services, MILSATCOM, and WWMCCS. Not only must the specific program's security 
requirements be met, but also the interface security requirements of the 
standard system programs. That is, program security requirements may have to be 
engineered and "dove-tailed" to access or emulate connections already on these 
systems and accreditation must be accomplished by these systems. Ideally, 
interface security issues should be considered during the conceptual phase when 
the interfacing framework and flows are first being addressed. Delaying 
addressing interface security issues means major revisions will almost certainly 
be required as the program matures.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.3.4.1.2   6 97">7.3.4.1.2 INCREASE IN TRUSTED 
SYSTEMS</A></H6>As "trusted" systems become more prevalent, they will 
increasingly impact on and interface with those automated information systems 
already designated as standard systems. Though the evolution of "trusted" 
systems is not yet near this point, there may come a time when one or more 
trusted systems are designated as standard Systems.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.3.4.2   5 97">7.3.4.2 COORDINATION WITH NSA</A></H5>Some 
programs are the sole responsibility of the operational organization. However, 
other programs may need assistance from the National Security Agency (NSA). This 
agency provides policy guidance and technical support to DoD organizations for 
automated information system security activities. This includes evaluating 
specifications, statements of work, and test plans. Sufficient lead time must be 
allowed to program necessary resources.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR7.4   3 98">7.4 PREPARING THE PROGRAM PLAN</A></H3>
<H4><A name="HDR7.4.1   4 98">7.4.1 ISSUES PRIOR TO PLAN PREPARATION</A></H4>The 
Program Management Directive (PMD) provides direction to participating commands 
and authorizes the program to proceed. The PMD gives a broad allocation of 
resources and levies major tasks on the players. The PMD serves as the source 
document for developing all further documentation. Although developing and 
maintaining the Program Plan is primarily the responsibility of the Program 
Manager (PM), the Security Manager is in the best position to give advice on 
security matters. The following three major factors must be addressed:
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.4.1.1   5 98">7.4.1.1 LOW COST</A></H5>The Program Manager is 
responsible for complying with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and DoD 
Directive 7920.1, Life-Cycle Management of Automated Information Systems, 
ensuring the automated information system is developed, acquired, evaluated, and 
logistically supported at a low cost. To do this he/she must comply with several 
requirements.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.4.1.1.1   6 98">7.4.1.1.1 HARDWARE REUSE</A></H6>DoD Directive 
7920.1 Life-Cycle Management of Automated Information Systems requires automated 
information systems to be acquired from commercial sources only if the 
requirement can not be met through the DoD reutilization program. This guidance 
must be followed, but the chance of a suitable, reused "trusted" system is very 
low, This is true for two reasons. At present there are only a handful of 
trusted systems in existence. Until the "trusted" technology has had time to 
mature, excess" trusted equipment will not be available. Secondly, equipment 
appearing on the Evaluated Products List (EPL) has been fielded; however, the 
equipment could be at the end of its economic life, making reuse unreasonable.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.4.1.1.2   6 98">7.4.1.1.2 SOFTWARE REUSE</A></H6>Besides the 
hardware reuse requirement, the Program Manager must also comply with the 
Federal Software Exchange Program by not procuring duplicate software. The 
comments regarding equipment also apply to software. At this time most "trusted" 
software is machine specific and "tailored" for each application. A major 
objective of the Information Systems Security Products and Services is to 
encourage private industry to develop "trusted technology."
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.4.1.1.3   6 98">7.4.1.1.3 OTHER SOURCES</A></H6>The PM must 
also consider "other sources" to realize a low cost. Although there is a slim 
chance of "piggybacking" on a "requirements contract" for the trusted System, it 
is unlikely one will be found which meets your requirements. One of the tasks is 
helping others realize these kinds of procurements will be unique until 
Government and industry have considerably more experience in this arena. 
"Business as usual" can not be expected.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.4.1.2   5 99">7.4.1.2 PROGRAM FUNDING PROFILE</A></H5>The PM 
is responsible for determining the specific resources required to implement the 
program and the funds needed to acquire the system. It must be ensured that 
security-relevant resources are priced and included in the profile. While some 
historical data is available, precisely allocating costs between external and 
internal security measures for a "trusted" system may be difficult. Early in the 
program when requirements are still being gathered or defined, a good "rule of 
thumb" is to use the cost for a System High Security Mode. This would provide 
costs for a complete suite of external controls and create a fiscal planning 
"hedge" for internal controls. As security requirements become better defined, 
the program security costs can be more precisely determined.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.4.1.3   5 99">7.4.1.3 PROGRAM STATUS 
REPORTING</A></H5>Although a Program Manager responsibility, status reporting is 
of vital interest. The Security Manager should arrange with the PM to have 
documents impacting security (e.g., Engineering Change Proposals) coordinated 
and provided from program inception. Changes should also be coordinated. Since 
the Program Manager has to specify reporting procedures in the Program 
Management Plan, information requirements should be identified early. Doing so 
will make tracking security-relevant issues easier, rather than attempting to 
"capture" the data later. It is also important to compile complete data to 
facilitate the elaborate documentation required for the certification and 
accreditation processes.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.4.2   4 99">7.4.2 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT PLAN</A></H4>This is the 
master plan for the automated information system acquisition. There are two 
primary interests in the writing of the Program Management Plan.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.4.2.1   5 99">7.4.2.1 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE</A></H5>The 
first interest is the section describing the program management structure and 
the relationships between the functional areas. The Program Management Plan 
should delegate to the Security Manager the authority to work security issues. 
The Program Management Plan should also clearly state the precedence security 
issues have in the scope of the program. An adequate structure should provide 
for consultation and coordination during each step in program development. If 
the Security Manager has been brought into the picture after the initial Program 
Management Plan has been released, and its organizational structure and 
relationships do not adequately address security, there must be a renegotiation 
of this portion of the Program Management Plan with the PM as soon as possible.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.4.2.2   5 99">7.4.2.2 "CALL-OUT" OF SUPPORT PLANS</A></H5>The 
second interest is the section devoted to "calling-out" support plans. For a 
major automated information system acquisition, a complete suite of support 
plans is warranted because there are so many different security facets to 
consider. More detail on the various support plans can be found below.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR7.5   3 100">7.5 CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT</A></H3>The Mission Need 
Statement (MNS) has a logical course and required elements. One required element 
in the MNS format is the Concept of Operations (CONOP). A Concept of Engineering 
(COE) and a Concept of Maintenance (COM) may also be presented in the MNS. 
However, if the last two concept statements are not in the MNS, they will 
usually be developed by the Program Management Office (PMO). The Security 
Manager should expect to help write and evaluate all three of these documents.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.5.1   4 100">7.5.1 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS</A></H4>Prepared by 
the functional user, the CONOP is a description of the environment and intended 
use of the automated information system. The CONOP has a security section that 
gives broad security guidance for the program. This section should include the 
sensitivity assessment, security mode of operation, and both hardware and 
software security mechanisms. Major programs generally have a separate System 
Security Concept of Operations (see Chapter 4, Threat Risk Management).
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.5.2   4 100">7.5.2 CONCEPT OF ENGINEERING</A></H4>The COE is a 
description of the overall approach to system engineering, usually prepared by 
the PMO. The COE addresses the equipment and software necessary to meet the 
needs of the user. The COE should use DoD 50t0.12-L terms to portray the 
engineering definition of the complete system. System engineering is required 
for a trusted system. The Concept of Engineering should address configuration 
management, software development, quality assurance, technical performance 
measurement, test and evaluation, and risk management.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.5.3   4 100">7.5.3 CONCEPT OF MAINTENANCE</A></H4>The COM is a 
description of the overall approach to maintaining the automated information 
system. The COM is usually prepared by the Program Management Office and must 
satisfy DoD Instruction 5000.2 (Part 6C) reliability and maintainability 
requirements, to satisfy the operational objectives specified in the CONOP, COE, 
and PMD. In a broad-brush manner, the COM discusses reliability, 
maintainability, sustainability, maintenance requirements, and performance 
criteria.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.5.4   4 100">7.5.4 CONCEPT AND SUPPORT PLANS</A></H4>Support 
plans discussed below, and their related concepts, are provided in Appendix B.
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR7.6   3 100">7.6 SUPPORT PLANS</A></H3>Each of the three 
functional concept descriptions (CONOP, COE, and COM) may be logically "linked" 
with specific support plans "called-out" by the Program Management Plan. These 
support plans have the details for the security "thread." Inputs and 
coordination should be provided on each of them.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.6.1   4 101">7.6.1 SUPPORT PLANS RELATED TO THE CONCEPT OF 
OPERATIONS</A></H4>There are two support plans related to the Concept of 
Operations.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.1.1   5 101">7.6.1.1 SURVIVABILITY SUPPORT PLAN</A></H5>This 
plan describes the ability to survive, reconstitute, and sustain operations. The 
plan should require "recovery" capabilities to obtain and transport duplicates 
of operating system and applications software and data files. Redundancy, 
alternate sites, and off-site arrangements are often key elements for 
survivability.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.1.2   5 101">7.6.1.2 TRAINING SUPPORT PLAN</A></H5>The 
Training Support Plan should include training in the security disciplines for 
both operations and maintenance personnel. This plan should include a module on 
system Security and provide the system administrator, security officer, 
maintainers, and users specific training commensurate with their level of system 
involvement. Security training is a necessary ingredient of computer security, 
whether for Government or contractor personnel. There are three cases to 
consider: a) contractor personnel may attend a contractor "in-house" training 
course, b) Government personnel may attend a contractor course, or c) Government 
personnel may attend a Government course. Each case should provide a measure of 
assurance that security training is properly weighted in the course program. 
Early planning is a necessity because the lead time to respond to a new 
requirement is significant.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.6.2   4 101">7.6.2 SUPPORT PLANS RELATED TO THE CONCEPT OF 
ENGINEERING</A></H4>Here, seven support plans have been identified as relating 
to the Concept of Engineering. 
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.2.1   5 101">7.6.2.1 CONTRACTING AND ACQUISITION SUPPORT 
PLAN</A></H5>This support plan should indicate the Security Manager's 
participation in the Data Call and the Data Requirements Review Board. This plan 
should acknowledge that security is a driving cost factor in the acquisition. 
The plan may also specify that the Security Manager serve as the Contracting 
Officer Technical Representative on all security issues. The Plan should reserve 
a place in the preparation of the Request for Proposal (RFP) and Statement of 
Work (SOW) for security requirements and specifications. See MlL-HDBK-245B and 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) for details on the content and 
structure of the RFP. See volume 2 of this guideline series for details on the 
content and structure of a SOW.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.2.2   5 102">7.6.2.2 SOURCE SELECTION PLAN</A></H5>The 
Source Selection Plan was addressed in Chapter 2, section 2.5.2.4, and will be 
further addressed in the fourth document of this guideline series. This plan 
describes the organization, roles, responsibilities, and functions of the Source 
Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB). This plan outlines award criteria and 
"evaluation factors" along with the scoring methodology. The Security Manager 
should prepare the security-relevant portion of the plan and participate in SSEB 
activities. He/she should expect to chair the Security Panel of the Technical 
Team. The very important Proposal Evaluation Guide (PEG) is derived from this 
plan and it should be absolutely ensured that the appropriate security criteria 
are included in the PEG.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.2.3   5 102">7.6.2.3 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN 
(CMP)</A></H5>Configuration management is a "must" for obtaining a "trusted" 
system rated division/class B2 or above. The CMP provides both high-level and 
detailed procedures on baselining the system and identifies components as well 
as identifying, processing, and controlling changes thereto. The Security 
Manager will need to serve on the Configuration Control Board to ensure 
security-relevant issues are adequately addressed. Without stringent hardware 
and software configuration management, control will be lacking to ensure only 
authorized and approved changes are made. As a result, the certifying authority 
will not be able to provide "certification" to the operational user.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.2.4   5 102">7.6.2.4 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT 
PLAN</A></H5>This is a major support plan for most automated information system 
acquisitions. All the COMPUSEC requirements and specifications should be 
described and a detailed approach outlined to satisfy them. This is where the 
contractor tells how he plans to satisfy the "Orange Book" criteria for the TCB 
class specified for the acquisition. Chapter 3, Computer Security, provides a 
brief overview of the software development process.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.2.5   5 102">7.6.2.5 HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TURNOVER SUPPORT 
PLAN</A></H5>This plan is intended to be a detailed listing of tasks to 
accomplish a "turnover" from the implementing command to the using command. 
Since implementation and conversion of an automated information system is 
substantially different than day-to-day operations, the Security Manager should 
review this plan to ensure security-relevant items have been included (e.g., 
user s manuals accompany the equipment, personnel are trained and available). 
The plan should provide a smooth, orderly transition. A checklist should be 
developed. There needs to be an orchestrated effort among all participants, or a 
high risk of a security breach at "start-up" will exist.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.2.6   5 102">7.6.2.6 TEST AND EVALUATION MASTER PLAN 
(TEMP)</A></H5>This plan is so critical that a separate chapter of this 
document, Chapter 5, Security Test and Evaluation, was written about security 
testing.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.2.7   5 103">7.6.2.7 QUALITY ASSURANCE SUPPORT 
PLAN</A></H5>Proper quality assurance is a prerequisite to an automated 
information system. This is true for hardware, software, and all supporting 
documentation. DoD-STD-2168, "Defense System Software Quality Program" is a 
valuable guide for software and outlines the quality assurance program. This 
document and the Quality Assurance Plan for security-relevant items need to be 
reviewed.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.6.3   4 103">7.6.3 SUPPORT PLANS RELATED TO THE CONCEPT OF 
MAINTENANCE</A></H4>This group of support plans is known as the Integrated 
Logistics Support Plan (ILSP). The plans are designed to support the performance 
of analyses which relate reliability, maintainability, and supportability to the 
operational requirements. Security must be considered in these analyses as an 
operational requirement. The Security Manager should attend all ILS reviews. DoD 
Instruction 5000.2 (Part 7A) discusses integrated logistic support and is the 
basic ILSP directive. DoD 5000.2-M (Parts 4C and 15) detail how to determine 
Life-Cycle Costs (LCC). Also note that security issues should be factored into 
the total life-cycle costs for the acquisition.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.3.1   5 103">7.6.3.1 MAINTENANCE PLANNING `SUPPORT 
PLAN</A></H5>Adequate maintenance is necessary to ensure the system will operate 
as intended. This plan should establish how many levels of maintenance will be 
performed and how they will be accomplished (e.g., cleared maintenance 
personnel, dial-up diagnostics, and warranty repairs).
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.3.2   5 103">7.6.3.2 SUPPLY SUPPORT PLAN</A></H5>Ensuring a 
fully functional supply pipeline is another essential task. The Security Manager 
should specify how critical security-relevant parts will be spared and which 
ones will be required to achieve a stated level of performance. This is 
especially true for Class A1 systems which require special parts handling. 
Responsiveness to changes is required in the environment that might change the 
security requirements, with adjustments as required.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.3.3   5 103">7.6.3.3 SUPPORT EQUIPMENT PLAN</A></H5>The 
Security Manager should review and coordinate on this plan if there are 
specialized test equipment or tool requirements for the system.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.3.4   5 103">7.6.3.4 TECHNICAL DATA SUPPORT 
PLAN</A></H5>Some of the security-relevant DIDs generate technical data (e.g., 
hardware and software specifications). It should be ensured that this support 
plan has a section for that data.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.3.5   5 104">7.6.3.5 COMPUTER RESOURCES LIFE-CYCLE 
MANAGEMENT PLAN (CRLCMP)</A></H5>This is also known as the Computer Resources 
Support Plan. The Security Manager should review DoD Instruction 5000.2 (Parts 6 
and 7) and Federal Information Resources Management Regulation at length. There 
may be some redundancy between this plan and some of the others, such as 
configuration management, but better safe than sorry. The Security Manager will 
be one of the major players in writing this plan. He/she should expect to chair 
the Computer Security Working Group and to be its representative to the Computer 
Resources Working Group.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.6.3.6   5 104">7.6.3.6 PACKING, HANDLING, STORAGE, AND 
TRANSPORTATION</A></H5>For highly classified systems (e.g., those dealing with 
Sensitive Compartmented Information), the Security Manager will need support 
from the Defense Courier Service (DCOS). For other systems, he/she will also 
need to consider the security protection measures required for air, road, and 
sea transport, if they are applicable. 
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR7.7   3 104">7.7 LIFE-CYCLE PHASES AND DATA 
DELIVERABLES</A></H3>There is a lot written about the life-cycle process in the 
cited references. Studying and comparing these references will reveal that the 
various milestone charts do not always agree. For example, the life-cycle itself 
can be divided into different phases, with each phase having a different name, 
and the individual milestones falling at different points along the time line. 
Do not let the differences be a source of confusion.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.7.1   4 104">7.7.1 FINEST BREAKDOWN OF LIFE-CYCLE 
PHASES</A></H4>First, the maximum set of phases is defined as: determine need, 
write requirements, develop concepts, validate concept, design, develop, test, 
deploy/implement, operate, support. Normally, any life-cycle phases will be 
represented by this list, with some neighboring phases combined and the names 
altered slightly. The authors of the referenced documents have chosen that 
combined set which best fits the purpose of the document, but each implicitly 
pertains to the expanded set. Figure 7-1 provides the acquisition milestones and 
phases from DoD Instruction 5000.2.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.7.2   4 105">7.7.2 GOVERNMENT/CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL 
MIX</A></H4>Keep in mind that each program has a different strategy, and so each 
may have different functions performed by both the Government and a contractor, 
or contractors. Contract award(s) could also occur at several points within the 
life-cycle. It is conceivable that a large and complex program could have an 
overall life-cycle, while subordinate parts could have their own different, or 
overlapping life cycles. Software development tends to be particularly volatile, 
and could also be managed as a separate program. Any program requires a degree 
of flexibility in adapting the requirements.
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.7.3   4 105">7.7.3 DATA DELIVERABLES</A></H4>In Appendix B to 
this document, the life-cycle is broken into several distinct periods of time. 
The data deliverables are shown in a typical time-phased Sequence, with 
suggested delivery dates keyed to major program milestones. Each program will 
have its own tailored schedule, but the conceptual flow of deliverables should 
be similar. The time phases with associated deliverables are described in the 
following paragraphs.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.7.3.1   5 105">7.7.3.1 CONCEPT AND DEFINITION 
PHASE</A></H5>During this phase, the focus is on defining requirements, 
evaluating alternative strategies for satisfying requirements and acquiring 
solutions, and planning for the execution of the program. The Request for 
Information and Request for Proposal will be released, proposal evaluation and 
source selection activities will be conducted, and the contract will be awarded.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.7.3.1.1   6 106">7.7.3.1.1 EARLY PLANNING 
DOCUMENTS</A></H6>Planning documents that were called out in the contract will 
be delivered to the SPO or PMO for review, and the process will be in full 
swing. Security should be addressed in nearly every document, but the first one 
to focus exclusively on security should be the System Security Plan (also called 
the Security Plan of Accomplishment). The System Security Plan and Operations 
Security Plans provide the foundation for further security-relevant efforts. 
They are, therefore, the first to be called out and delivered.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.7.3.1.2   6 106">7.7.3.1.2 MORE SPECIFIC PLANS</A></H6>The 
next set of security-relevant documents to be delivered are the System Security 
Concept of Operations, Accreditation Plan, Certification Plan, and Security Test 
and Evaluation Annex to the Test and Evaluation Master Plan. These plans provide 
specific information on what the contractor intends to do to satisfy Statement 
of Work and Security Specification requirements.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.7.3.1.3   6 106">7.7.3.1.3 EARLY WORK EFFORT</A></H6>The third 
set of security-relevant documents in this initial group reflects the results of 
the contractor's initial efforts to interpret and satisfy the contractual 
Statement of Work and Security Specifications. These documents should be the 
draft Technical Reports covering the Security Audit, the Computer Security 
Policy Model (when required), the Risk Assessment, and the Cost Benefit 
Analysis.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.7.3.2   5 106">7.7.3.2 DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND TEST 
PHASE</A></H5>During this phase, the emphasis is on designing, building, and 
testing the automated information system and its components. Specific solutions 
to each requirement are spelled out and the automated information system begins 
to take shape.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.7.3.2.1   6 106">7.7.3.2.1 ENGINEERING 
SPECIFICATIONS</A></H6>All the major planning documents should now be in-place 
and approved by the Government. The contractor then begins to document the 
engineering design of the specific security protection features that are 
required. The engineering specifications are developed and delivered, in 
sequence and iteratively, from general to specific. Thus, the next set of 
documents delivered to the Government should be the "A", "B", and "C" 
specifications. Once the design specifications are complete and approved, the 
contractor begins to build the configuration items and other components of the 
system.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.7.3.2.2   6 107">7.7.3.2.2 TEST DOCUMENTATION</A></H6>Once the 
security protection feature design configuration begins to take shape, 
development Security Test Plans are formulated. These plans are reviewed by the 
Government before actual testing begins. As testing is conducted, the results 
are documented and provided to the Government in Test Reports. As development 
testing is completed and the build configuration becomes known, operational Test 
Plans are formulated. Again, these plans are reviewed by the Government before 
actual testing begins, with results provided in Test Reports.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.7.3.2.3   6 107">7.7.3.2.3 OTHER TECHNICAL 
DOCUMENTS</A></H6>Several other security-relevant deliverables fall into this 
life-cycle phase. They include the Covert Channel Analysis (when required) and 
Trusted Computing Base Configuration Management Plan. The Certification Support 
package is also delivered near the end of this phase and includes the results of 
both development and operational testing, as well as the engineering 
documentation.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.7.3.3   5 107">7.7.3.3 OPERATION AND IMPLEMENTATION 
PHASE</A></H5>This period corresponds to the time at which an item or system is 
fielded for use (and continuously used). The automated information system 
acquisition is complete and the mission user now assumes responsibility for the 
operation and maintenance of the system.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.7.3.3.1   6 107">7.7.3.3.1 USER DOCUMENTATION</A></H6>The two 
deliverables in this category are the Trusted Facility Manual and the Security 
Features Users Guide. These documents describe how the automated information 
system security protection features are implemented, and how to use them.
<P>
<H6><A name="HDR7.7.3.3.2   6 107">7.7.3.3.2 ACCREDITATION SUPPORT</A></H6>The 
final security-relevant deliverable is the Accreditation Support package. This 
culminates the acquisition effort and should result in automated information 
System accreditation by the Designated Approving Authority (DAA). 
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.7.4   4 107">7.7.4 USE OF DOD 5010.1 2-L ACQUISITION 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND DATA REQUIREMENTS CONTROL LIST (AMSDL)</A></H4>The AMSDL 
provides an index of DoD Data Item Descriptions (DIDs) that have been approved 
for general use in defense contracts. The DIDs are used to specify format and 
content of data from contractors when the information is judged essential to the 
Government. The AMSDL is the most thorough reference for DIDs for general use 
during contracting activities. The third book in this guideline series 
introduces DIDs that will be submitted by NSA for inclusion in the AMSDL.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.7.4.1   5 108">7.7.4.1 AMSDL ORGANIZATION</A></H5>The AMSDL 
has four main sections: 1) Source documents and related DIDs by Data Functional 
Assignment; 2) Numerical Listing of DIDs; 3) Keyword Index of DIDs; 4) and 
Canceled or Superseded Listing. The front portion of the AMSDL gives an 
explanation of how to use each section and its format. These instructions should 
be reviewed before attempting to use the AMSDL. Unless the DID number is already 
known, the best bet is to use the Keyword Index to isolate the subject area.
<P>
<H5><A name="HDR7.7.4.2   5 108">7.7.4.2 WHAT THE AMSDL DOES NOT 
CONTAIN</A></H5>The AMSDL does not contain data requirements mandated under 
other Public Laws, Federal Statutes, or the DoD supplement to the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.7.5   4 108">7.7.5 DELIVERABLE MEDIA</A></H4>Each of the data 
deliverables called for in the contract will be delivered to the Government in 
the manner specified by the CDRL. In every case, the contractor should be 
required to deliver at least one hard copy, with more requested if required. The 
contractor should also be required to provide the deliverables on floppy 
diskettes. These diskettes should be prepared using the same word processor that 
the program office (and ideally the mission user) uses. This will simplify 
editing and distribution. If formal specification and modeling languages are 
used, deliverables should be provided in "machine usable" format. Some 
deliverables may be appropriate for microfiche or microfilm. This determination 
should be made early, as special equipment is required to prepare and read this 
type of media. Any electronic deliverables should be ensured by the contractor 
to be malicious logic free.

<H4><A name="HDR7.8.1   4 108">7.8.1 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY 
TRANSFER</A></H4>Program Management Responsibility Transfer is the milestone 
where the Program Management Office turns over the acquired system to the 
operational user. Ideally, all the program's critical paths merge at this point. 
However, this ideal is seldom achieved. There are usually some incomplete 
actions and either the PMO or the mission user must accept responsibility for 
their completion. 
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.8.2   4 108">7.8.2 COMPLETION OF CERTIFICATION</A></H4>Up to 
this point, the single most significant security achievement has been the 
certification of the automated information system. At the time of responsibility 
transfer, the System is turned over to the operational user for accreditation 
and mission use. With the tools in this guideline, the DAA can be provided with 
the necessary documentation and assurances needed to accredit the system for use 
in the operational environment. (See Chapter 6, Certification and 
Accreditation.)
<P>
<H4><A name="HDR7.8.3   4 109">7.8.3 THE FIELDED SYSTEM</A></H4>A fielded system 
is subject to host-tenant support agreements, maintenance management, equipment 
and supply management, continuing configuration management, hardware and 
software engineering changes, designation assignment in the inventory, coding 
and "call-out as a wartime resource, unit reporting, and all the other 
day-to-day requirements levied upon any automated information system. If the 
Program Manager has done his job well during acquisition, he/she should not 
hesitate to accept a follow-on job to operate the system. 
<P>
<H3><A name="HDR7.9   3 110">7.9 REFERENCES</A></H3>There are several basic 
references to have and/or read to gain a detailed understanding of the program 
management function in the acquisition of secure systems. Most have been 
introduced previously.
<P>a. "Federal Acquisition Regulation" (FAR) and "DoD FAR Supplement" (DFAR) - 
This document is the primary regulation in acquisition and must be used as the 
basis for acquisition activities. The FAR is helpful as well in defining terms 
and procedures; however, it may require an expert to interpret details.
<P>b. DoD Directive 5000.1, "Defense Acquisition" - After the FAR, this 
directive is the primary policy and guidance document for DoD acquisitions.
<P>c. DoD Instruction 5000.2, "Defense Acquisition Management Policies and 
Procedures" - This instruction is the primary source of acquisition policy and 
procedures, describing in significant detail the various issues that might 
arise. The document pertains to both major acquisitions and non major ones. It 
presents an overview of the acquisition milestone phases and milestones. It then 
details requirement and affordability issues. In typical Automated Information 
System acquisition it will be found that some of the detail of this document is 
not applicable.
<P>d. DoD 5000.2-M, "Defense Acquisition Management Documentation and Reports" -

<H2><A name="HDR 2 112"><B>A.1 INTRODUCTION</B></A></H2>A large body of policy 
is available in the form of regulations, directives, Presidential Executive 
Orders, and Office of Management and Budget Circulars. This policy serves as a 
basis for the procedures to handle and process Federal information, particularly 
classified information. Section 7 of DoD 5200.28-STD "Trusted Computer System 
Evaluation Criteria," is entitled "The Relationship Between Policy and the 
Criteria." That section identifies much of the preceding policy and discusses 
its relationship to establishing control objectives for computer security. 
Program Managers should familiarize themselves with both the Introduction to DoD 
5200.28-STD and Section 7, because the basic documents discussed will be 
encountered again and again in security literature.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR 2 113"><B>A.2 DISCUSSED IN THE ORANGE BOOK</B></A></H2>The 
following is a brief summary of the most important historical references 
discussed in section 7 of DoD 5200.28-STD:
<P>a. Brooks Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-306), (Title 40, United States Code, 
Section 759), "Automatic Data Processing Equipment" - This act, and the 
amendments thereto, vested in the Administrator of General Services the 
authority and the responsibility for the acquisition of all automatic data 
processing equipment (ADPE) and telecommunications resources, unless 
specifically exempted. GSA relegates that authority to other agencies through 
delegations of procurement authority (DPAs) (regulatory delegations, specific 
agency delegations, or specific acquisition delegations).
<P>b. The Nunn-Warner Amendment (or Warner Amendment) to the Brooks Act (Title 
10, United States Code, Section 2315), "Law Inapplicable to the Procurement of 
Automatic Data Processing Equipment and Services for Certain Defense Purposes" - 
This amendment specifically exempted DoD acquisitions of Mission Critical 
Computer Resources (MCCR) from the DPA requirement.
<P>c. Ware, W.H., ed., "Security Controls for Computer Systems, Report of 
Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security," AD-A07661 7/0, Rand
<P>Corporation, February 1970, reissued October 1979 - This is a report of the 
findings of a 1967 task force. It contains policy and technical recommendations 
to reduce threat of compromise of classified information.
<P>d. OMB Circular Number A-71 Transmittal Memorandum No. 1, "Security of 
Federal Automated Information Systems," July 1978 - This circular requires each 
Federal agency to implement a computer security program and defines a minimum 
set of controls to be incorporated into such programs. (This document was 
superseded by OMB Circular Number A-I 30, see section A.3.c.)
<P>e. Executive Order 12356, "National Security Information," April 6, 1982 - 
This document established the high-level security initiative. It is expected to 
be followed by the Secretary of Defense and others.
<P>f. DoD 5200.1-R, "Information Security Program Regulation," August 1982 and 
June 1986 - This regulation established policy for the safeguarding of 
classified, sensitive unclassified, and unclassified information processed in 
AIS.
<P>g. DoD 5220.22-M, "Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified 
Information" - This manual provided security guidance for DoD contractor AISs.
<P>h. DoD Directive 5200.28, "Security Requirements for Automated Information 
Systems (AISs)," (previously entitled "Technique and Procedure for Implementing, 
Deactivating, Testing and Evaluating Secure Resource-Sharing ADP Systems"), 
December 1972, May 1977, April 1978, March 1988, and 21 May 1988 - This 
directive is the overall security policy document for systems that process 
classified data.
<P>i. DoD 5200.28-M, "Automated Information System Security Manual," (previously 
entitled "Technique and Procedure for Implementing, Deactivating, Testing and 
Evaluating Secure Resource-Sharing ADP Systems"), January 1973, June 1979, and 
Draft revision April 1991 - This manual was authorized by and supported DoD 
Directive 5200.28.
<P>j. DoD Directive 5215.1, "Computer Security Evaluation Center," 25 October 
1982 - This directive established the security prOduct evaluation program. NSA 
has aggressively undertaken the task to study and implement computer security 
technology. NSA has encouraged the widespread availability of trusted computer 
products for use by any organization desiring better protection for their 
sensitive data.
<P>k. OMB Circular Number A-123, "Internal Control Systems," August 1986 - This 
OMB circular establishes confidence and accountability in the protection of 
Federal AIS operations from fraud, waste, and abuse. It requires the development 
of management control plans based on such actions as vulnerability assessments 
and personnel performance agreements.
<P>l. DoD Directive 7920.1, "Life Cycle Management of Automated Information 
Systems," October 17, 1978 (updated June 20, 1988) - This directive minimized 
acquisition cost through life-cycle management according to phases and 
milestones.
<P>m. DoD 5200.28-STD, "Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation 
Criteria" - This document was originally issued as DoD Computer Security Center 
CSC-STD-001-83 on 15 August 1983, it was reissued 26 December 1985 as a 
Department of Defense Standard.
<P>
<H2><A name="HDR 2 115"><B>A.3 SINCE THE ORANGE BOOK</B></A></H2>A few important 
policy documents have been published since the finalization and subsequent 
adaptation of DoD 520028-STD in December of 1985, and therefore are not 
referenced in Section 7 of that document. They include:
<P>a. Update of DoD Directive 5200.28, "Technique and Procedure for 
Implementing, Deactivating, Testing and Evaluating Secure Resource-Sharing ADP 
Systems," March 1988 - This update provides minimum security guidelines and more 
specific guidance for classified and sensitive information protection, 
specifically the specification of C2 criteria under DoD 5200.28-STD by 1992.
<P>b. National Security Decision Directive 145,17 December 1984 - This directive 
was developed by the policy and organizational structure steering group, 
Secretary of Defense for Automated Information. This document was replaced by 
National Security Directive 42, 5 July 1990. 
<P>c. OMB Circular Number A-I 30, "Management of Federal Information Resources," 
December 1985, Appendix III, "Security of Federal Automated Information Systems" 
- Superseding OMB Circular A-71,this document requires that systems be approved 
for processing based on the adequacy of the safeguards. It establishes 
requirements for the effective and efficient use and management of Federal 
information resources. It requires that all agency information systems possess a 
level of security commensurate with the sensitivity of the information and also 
commensurate with the risk and harm that could result from improper operation. 
(This document supersedes OMB Circular A-71, see Section A.2.d.) 
<P>d. NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1-87, "National Telecommunications and Information 
Systems Security (NTISS) Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation Security 
Guideline" - This guideline provides guidance to users of microprocessor-based 
systems used for such functions as typing, filing, calculating, and 
sending/receiving electronic mail.
<P>e. Public Law 100-235, "Computer Security Act of 1987," January 1988 - Over 
53,000 Federal information systems have been designated as sensitive in 
compliance with this document. The results of this act are not reflected in the 
1988 update to DoD Directive 5200.28. However, they have been reflected in the 
April 1991 draft revision to DoD 5200.28-M.
